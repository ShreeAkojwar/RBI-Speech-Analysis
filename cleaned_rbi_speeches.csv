weighted average call market rates moving together difference two actually come fiscal year cp cd rate movements could also reflecting things transmission repo rate call money rate conse quently beyond dr raghuram g rajan think engaged certainly trying look liquidity conditions liquidity framework factors looked general point sense rket certainly demand liquidity also supplying plenty demand proof pudding precisely weighted average call rate hugging policy rate vishal goel ubs securities question stressed loans scope asset quality review rbi rbi go weak corporates banks select corporates dr raghuram g rajan let ask mr mundra answer question shri ss mundra see scope sense conduct asset quality review banks every year difference process time come rather spacing year pooled within certain period otherwise followed process past year together given advantage accounts rather looking isolation could looked totality across banking system observations discussed banks shared banks encouraged proactively conservatively look accounts classify appropriately need prepare future possibility weakness arising way enhanced provisioning vishal goel basically assume rbi already highlighted like almost cases would thought stressed think like would list come rbi shri ss mundra think appreciate one thing portfolio static entity one give point time look portfolio always development either take account identified earlier positive movement happened looking economy around developments may inclusion say point time reasonable assurance larger part portfolios looked dr raghuram g rajan couple additions one course banks look entire portfolio time plus look entire portfolio perhaps degree scrutiny annual financial inspections think answer broadly yes mr mundra said bulk problem looked us detail also broadly looked us banks contin ue looking second even course process height ened awareness proactive behavior banks loans actually turned around loans put back track promoters selling ass ets brining money etc f course reverse also happen loans normal may go track something dynamic situation watch see broadly yes anurag mantr jefferies firstly assume asset classification accounts identified review uniform across banks end fy end two quarters shri ss mundra exactly mean uniform anur ag mantr sir example certain banks spoken second degree effects asset quality review terms may bank classifying n account npa another probably asking end accou nts identified potentially stressed asset classification across banks currently diverging shri ss mundra think explanation asked also contained previous reply let clarify asset classification continue governed rule based system vogue point time within quite possible account npa one bank may npa another bank viewed record recovery perspective essentially two outcome governor mentioned identification come bank per rule classified npa trigger two things one may corrective action part promoters well banks may need account slipping npa category banks existing bank also upgrade period time outcome could wh en account npa bank may gives indication banks become sensitive weakness account start preparing weakness manifest way provisioning whole e xercise moved direction going forward mentioned either account come back upgraded category f provisioning started prepares banks better deal account really falls npa category anurag mantr secondly could help us understand would typical haircut would assumed various stressed sectors like say iron steel metals infra etc various scenario would worked dr raghuram g rajan typically stress particular loan depends period deterioration taken place longer period deterioration bigger haircut sense don’t think uniform number give account toaccount basis broadly soon entity starts getting period say cash flow stress period onwards account ages extent provisioning required goes anurag mantr could give us take takeover discom bonds states extra bonds issued discoms would bagged states terms asset classification provisioning dr raghuram g rajan state replace bank’s loan bonds equal value state asset classification performing since states paying performing loan investment essentially anurag mantr even though bonds would issued discoms eventually bagged states issued states directly dr raghuram g rajan think still discussing plays bonds issued state banks lieu loans banks made discoms absolutely question asset quality dhaval gada motilal oswal securities firstly rbi asset quality review cover stressed exposures banks overseas operations well also exposures stressed group taken credit substitutes second question clarity balance sheet cleanup march mean going towards direction banks recognize potential stressed asset npa increase coverage exposures march could see increase provisioning even subsequent years dr raghuram g rajan second question intent broadly get problem aken care time shri mundra said continuing loans coming back standard classification loans going hope time bulk exercise finished positives match negatives sense balance sheet stabilized moreover balance sheet transparent know problems largely taken care shri ss mundra add considering first part question overseas exposure mentioned whole exercise intended overall review encourage banks proactively deal problem know large part overseas exposure banking community respect entity exposure sitting india n book kind review done banks take proactive measure think quite logical would looking – exposure sitting books india well exposure sitting overseas books dhaval gada sir would possible give broad sense would level provisioning quantum stress ed loan could materialize whole exercise dr raghuram g rajan moving target said mapped different scenarios think important banks basically follow process think good indicator probably results declaring clean don’t want pre judge process giving numbers done basically looked variety possible numbers various scenarios assured system enough capital absorb numbers well truly feasible possibility mahrukh adajani ya idfc question also pertains asset quality basically review asset quality review seen bank results seen similar size banks reporting divergent asset quality go data available whether mca data sector wise disclosures banks feel right divergence would review review dr raghuram g rajan know going actually constant communication banks prepare declare results certainly consult us intent essentially making sure level playing field disclosures see sense mr mundra said banks record recovery technical phrase implying history payments loan loan may performing one bank may nonperforming another bank simply borrower keeping one bank’s payments time asset classification differences tend equalize reason may certain bank classified particular loan classified elsewhere extent may variation broadly announcements banks reflect sense need see bank announcing relatively low provisioning time probably means need shri ss mundra would say similar size banks mean similar kinds portfolios banks may similar size portfolios may vastly different even accounts sitting portfolio banks quite possible loan size different think things would ultimately reflect level provisioning charge pl respective banks make hemendra bhatia vadilal forex look indian rupee last one month almost appreciated chinese yuan policy rbi actually allow rupee depreciate us dollar counter yuan depreciation dr raghuram g rajan repeat “ mantra ” actually follow intervene case excessive volatility try maintain level rate depreciation currencies done continue don’t look part icular currencies say moved lot intervene basis srinivas v deutsche bank given nominal growth challenge economy faces right given backdrop really imposition inflation targeting framework really necessary balance given nominal growth challenge case actually change functioning interest rate corridor current width basis points calibrate lower may basis points recalibration targeted liquidity deficit keeping sanctity inflation targeting framework dr raghuram g rajan missing link nominal g dp “difficulty ” corridor f irst would say seems cpi still services accounting value added assuming deflationary structure economy point perhaps little stretched denying fact overall gdp deflators depending calculate come hard see significant negative given size services economy well extent agriculture sector yes anufacturing experiencing period deflation largely result lower input cost much traditional reasons think nominal gdp problem extent perhaps overstated point let us see progresses fact actual problem see inflation coming substantially give monetary policy sufficient room act broader issue size corridor amongst issues explore take verall look framework srinivas v clarify link really meant clear really transmission perspective given shock degrees freedom provided changing width corridor dr raghuram g rajan biggest contribution transmission probably change marginal cost pricing april st would direct contribution credit course may mind transmission bond markets said take overall view see additional concerns broadly speaking point think reasonable job providing liquidity mangesh kulkarni almondz global securities wanted know progress gyan sangam meeting held last year next gyan sangam meeting expected shri ss mundra would appreciate gyan sangam exercise rbi’s presence observer get detailed elaborate answer question needs direct ed elsewhere second part question understand next gyan sangam proposed held first week march brinda jagirdar independent economist given books banks still concern government moved small saving rate bond market rates also softened conducive conditions transmission monetary policy rate dr raghuram g rajan good question guess tried answer different ways give phrase ‘small saving rates’ clearly looking government linking bond market rates allow flexible time give investors put money small saving instruments n adequate return ties market returns help transmission broader issue transmission shri khan said bond markets time think credit markets also clearly looking sense come april st change marginal cost pricing well time banks compete lend think see greater transmission take place optimistic matter time rather significant impediments process alpana

balance growth inflation also sensitive fact growth coming sectors interest rate sensitive believe done today along roadmap normalizing policy rates lata venkatesh lata venkatesh cnbc tv dr subba rao said inflati problem fairly serious strong statement like balance risks sh ifted slowdown inflation said india outlier terms inflation much higher countries definitely emerging market country pointedl said even negative year interest rate scenario inspite pol icy move bit small step basis means going remain negative real interest rate scenario practically better part year entire year would ju stify small move would think move many times policy dr subbarao let answer second question first whether move many times time looks like moved many times okay second part question whether move mid cycle let explain opport unity explain moved mid cycle march someth ing done lightly done considerable thought thought dvisable waste nother weeks till scheduled policy rule mid cycle action know situation evolve want say mething lightly think many times taking mid cycle action ruled something part going become routine second questi substantive whether still negative territory justify negative territory guess paraphrase said earlier yes policy rates negative real policy rates negative even today’s adjustment taken account th e inflation dynamics see next severa l months taken account liquidity system taken account government borrowing requirement taken account revival private credit demand taking account factors calibrated today’s policy action everything need done one step believe moving several baby steps towards normalization better economy adjust pre prices growth… subir dr subir gokarn think people get little obsessed headline inflation number also emphasis one main drivers calculation action march announcement today nonfood manufactured inflation rate move negative positive february ubstantial move fact viewpoint sort unanticipated component dr iver inflation sort precipitated action march take essentially reflecting underlying demand clearly significant issue would suggest given actions normalization idea comparing reining possibility demand spike think actions entirely cons istent situation food price dynamics already pointed really within control monsoons make difference terms whether expectations oderation course year going play know st ands think shift inflation dynamics almost entirely food till november last year half coming non food manufacturing really big cons ideration really mean balance risks shifted slowdown inflation really underlying driver picking lata venkatesh ask supplementary question sir post yo u mentioned nonfood manufacturing inflation trigger call unusual mid cycle rate hike would key parameters watch take step considered nice step parameters would watch would worry dr subbarao parameter watch short answer questions ask reserve bank colleagues want say multiple indicator model takes account macro economic situ ation returns various financial markets th ey start number macro economy variables study situation since st udy model get informed get advised look nonfood manufacture inflation look nonoil imports noncoal imports look iip look credit growth look fuel inflation look commodity prices look gl obal prospects number variables fact variables monitor monitor okay sense want give much talking nonfood manufacture indicator look dr subir gokarn number seen context context seen capacity seen past months increase capacity survey measures know getting indications analysts well overall across work capacity utilization increasing scen ario threat risks commodity prices food prices energy prices spilling sort sustained inflation process increase think really one important indicator us something basically observe quarterly frequency surveys take long time complete first context capacity utilization pricing power corporate pe rformance look inflation numbers allows us hopefully sort rea ssured confident judgment whether pressure sustainable whethe r te mporary phenomenon alpana killawala pradeep pradeep one inflation stated yester day’s report well today’s policy talked asset price inflation ou said

awaaz wanted know inflation done till march projection given us line like rbi would comfortable target internal target set target number would like know dr subbarao internal target months nil also trajectory given document read trajectory actually draw chart continuous could broken thing okay know flation move things moves somewhat trend start know ee trend may go straight line might stay level months base effect taken june base effected set forth participant sir could give us timeframe till see inflationary pressures staying firm also given estimate financial year could give us reasons factors could supporting number dr subbarao know want venture trajectory fro today’s studying numbers figures access thing believe inflation might stay level next onths base effect supply side factors coming rabi crop come commodity prices might adjust demand might pickup number factors might work sides work inflation trajectory come dow n know first food side prospect better rabi crop pr ospect hopefully good monsoon monsoon good soften inflation commodity prices clear global recovery gradual believe commodity price may firm factors influence inflation anything missed subir subir gokarn think point emphasis looking march expectations outcome many things importantly normal monsoon expectation softening inflation ba sed outcome monsoons disastrous point early indications typically case near normal monsoon forecast aggregate number matters way distributed across country also acro ss four months period monsoon unknown parameters point monsoons normal food production normal certainly see softening f ood prices time recovery consolidating capacities ge tting stretched would see hardening manufactures sector pricing balance tween two forces going drive inflation trajectory actions aimed softening later trying keep check growth pressures nonfood manufacturing prices forecast projections based normal monsoon actions taking taken today possibly take future actually desired impacts terms reining inflationary expectations putting sort limits inflation process alpana killawala bijoy newswire bijoy sir bijoy newswire sir stressing monsoon key factor whereas met department supposed come it’s forecast next weeks feel time could probably start looking reviewing policy looking figures forecast come sir would possible would look mid cycle dr subbarao alone trigger mid cycle action

targeting whole evolution inflation years kaushik das deutsche bank two questions first question potential growth rate rbi considering model decide future monetary policy action second regarding transmission saw last easing cycle basis points repo rate cut significant cut crr well got basis points cut bank lending rate time around bank lending rate cuts happen probably small amount even achieve basis points cut lending rate course monetary policy cycle time around think enough kind support economic recovery investment side rather consumption side dr raghuram g rajan let start question turn potential growth question michael important cut interest rates sense deposit rates available banks commensurate interest rate cut words cutting interest rates inflation stays really high may difficult banks cut deposit rates cannot outrun pace disinflation bring interest rates transmission simply happen simply banks room cut interest rates case far seen number banks c ut deposit rates question much time take cuts feed lending rates two factors play favo ur happening sooner rather later one fact credit growth tepid banks sit ting tremendous amounts liquidity deploy today lending sbi chairman said evidence lending also picking second markets willing lend lower rates result banks start cutting lending rates find increasingly disintermediated clearly detrimental profit sense pass happen readily time partly first point made accompanied significant reduction cpi inflation remember previous time around focus wpi inflation cpi inflation still relatively high different time dr urjit r patel add previous cycle easing prematurely truncated part us fed policy tantrums ensued therefore full pass could effected reasons well aware dr michael patra first let clarify purpose monetary policy setting important know level potential output potential growth growth potential output potential output tells business cycle therefore position policy addressed monetary policy report important thing note potential output always difficult measure sixteen quarters data becomes even ifficult tried approach structural sense terms contributions labo ur capital productivity tried estimate sort trend given th limited history data give yo u various versions trend estimations monetary policy review give us estimates trend growth rates range chosen feasible trend rate growth economy going forward gather history information new gdp series work potential output release public domain doad manpreet kaur mecklai financial sir question increasing corporate vulnerability recently got data ecb increased billion quarter december sir looking hedging ratio declining since like july august decreased april august lookin g risk management proposal corporate negligible part expect rbi come picture increase kind risk management proposal corporate action policies sir second question implementation bas el iii planning increase bas el iii coming year also hinders process corporate increase focus hedging adds extra cost process take dr raghuram g rajan let ask mr khan respond question ecbs shri h r khan sure data gave billion one quarter far correct think correct information case implicit ceiling minds last years ecb borrowings within ceiling although external borrowings increasing percentage gdp ecb one f countries high nevertheless articulated number times unhedged exposure firm level r isk well importantly systemic level risk prudential side l aid guidelines terms additional provisioning additional capital charge issue boils capture information lot suggestions come working whether bring crilc wheth er put balance sheet disclosure icai steps thinking get information think trying overall say percentage hedging remains low encouraging people hedge also simultaneously steps taken including step taken recently expanding option framework also hedging increases efforts increase instruments think multiple actions different f ronts ensure corporates hedge governor emphasizing people take “ stability f rupee granted ” lull complacency telling dr raghuram g rajan also thro w number net ecb april january billion manpreet kaur sir december quarter recently went article wa saying like quite leading financial publication dr raghuram g rajan may looking approvals may looking one side really need stock net change billion april january relatively small numbers one aware substantial explosion ecbs think colleagues think numbers bear thrust question “are going think draconian measures ” answer ‘no’ would like incentiv ize corporations perhaps find better ways banks monitor examine regulations basis point think clear measure contemplated way manpreet kaur sir implementation bas eliii process saying turning bas eliii terms process see hedging followed corporate rbi wants hedging motivated among corporates cover risk bas eliii becomes hindrance process corporate get hedging hedge exposures shri r gandhi baseliii related requirements banks corporates manpreet kaur obviously bank would incurring bank keep extra capital credit required bank also even wo uld incentivized corporates also get long term hedging shri r gandhi true sense banks additional capital costing appropriately price services corporate booked longterm interest banks capabilities financial health proper risk management seen angle mohan po ddar fincap investments question regarding inflation index ed bonds current level cpi wpi inflation index ed bonds quoted deep discounts market factoring fall inflation henceforth shri hrkhan actually issued inflation index ed bond think around outstanding could follow subsequent issuances inflation trajectory gone different direction deep discounts discussion government revised version inflation index ed bond institutional investor well retail investor let us see new thing comes possibly could consider take care illiquid inflation index ed bond whether switching take view kumar rachapudi anz bank two questions one liquidity conditions mentioned view quite flush look indicators like either reserve money even incremental credit deposit ratio right th e last months versus ldr ratio overall banks obviously daily basis notwithstanding fact deposit ing money term reverse repos rbi still net borrowers central bank wondering thinking liquidity conditions accommodative second question sterilization f x inflows rbi probably look f x month implied yields around much higher overnight rate think way sterilizing prohibiting corporate hedging f x liabilities considering ways sterilization dr raghuram g rajan first question think looking overly march numbers liquidity generally tight look forward see happens liquidity unwinds forward looking perspective saying plenty l iquidity market second question far forward premium goes intervene take account various issues including size premia etc deciding might effective way intervene said f act premia sometimes push variety reasons intervention example credit tight arbitrage leg create synthetic forward may difficult may therefore imply higher premium otherwise wo uld treat expansion premium primarily rbi intervention could variety reasons kumar rachapudi sir following question liquidity assessment see banks borrowing le us say may june april presuming increased government spending borrowing slightly lower numbers march according projections numbers may june dr michael patra lot contingent factors economy let us say economy goes turning point moves obviously little excess demand liquidity let us say less agricultur al activity mons oon turn favourable see completely different roll liquidity may june early forecast liquidity june many imponderables exist today imran ayed aegon religare question probably partly answered related inflation index ed bonds good looking forward issuing cpi linked inflation index ed bonds start visibility last time around bonds issued people created products around inflation index ed bonds bonds longer issued issue cpi linked bonds could give us roadmap certainty issued future develop certain products certain business case around inflation index ed bonds provide customers real hedge inflation also business case us dr raghuram g rajan good suggestion certainly k eep mind aastha g udwani birla sun life asset management sir one question three conditions spirit actually four laid one condition accommodative monetary policy stance going forward point conditions take least may longer months terms shaping impact decipher next policy rate move actually deferred time four conditions met dr raghuram g rajan sure say conditions met seems mind numerical something clear yes condition think conditions reflecting kinds things would like see movement precisely much something look compositely looking happening including information comes would ascribe threshold number conditions say falls x action forthcoming composite big picture going look put elements play longer time announcements made likely happen also give us sense composite picture aastha g udwani sir would allow one point talking example impact transmissions front loaded rate cuts supply response inputs power land announcements intention things happen rbi going look next action dr raghuram g rajan trying get precise saying look elements develop composite sense obviously transmission take place much likely sort prospects happening things wil l gauge determining make next move want precise saying elements need look anjali verma phillip capital two questions one talk real interest rates looking repo interest rate looking deposit rate second question although understand rbi largely targeting focused achieving cpi targets right completely ignoring wpi isinflation underway dr raghuram g rajan far real interest rate goes thus far talking risk free real interest rate indian context typically would mean look forward cpi something like repo rate minus look forward cpi would good definition working definition think real interest rate far wpi goes clearly issue number look form going international forces effect wpi well corporate pressures often number indicates extent corporate pricing power corporate input cost gives us sense corporate see inflation different say citizen element thinking target cpi wpi naveen sharma hdfc life two questions one fiscal consolidation path saying government deleveraging path going fiscal consolidation path private sector see idprivate also deleveraging path banks able lend big ticket size ca pital cons trained talking psu banks constitute total book fii limits opened whatever corporate bond fii limits precisely money going pfcs one question whe n economy picks going fund growth dr raghuram g rajan good question economy picks alert funding constraints see starkly see certainly alert think government also alert perhaps capital needs psu banks let us see room banks bring especially psus access markets raise capital markets also government psus market access make case need capital sure point capital forthcoming government position right mean thinking active discussion going government things naveen sharma sir one question wpi cpi ha answered stark difference fuel inflation wpi cpi core reason used close last three four readings rbi looking think difficult get composition cpi right way data collected obviously series old rbi looking also headline number core number go ing dr michael patra petrol eum import reflected wpi reflected cpi fuel households consume fuel category find really firewood electricity prices determining evolution fuel category motor fuels households use transport communication cpi difference wpi cpi watch closely srinivas deutsche bank sir one square forecast inflation growth end year backdrop flexible inflation targeting really look one applies basically monetary policy rule forecast inflation growth one square stance guidance given dr raghuram g rajan basically think hint ing measure potential growth plug figure going tell whether consistent stance right think wh michael talked earlier course admit still trying understand new cso numbers somewhat constrained project growth based new numbers understand well thought understood old numbers may se em michael said determining potential growth easy short series data creates little bit noise feel fairly comfortable stance given think us old growth numbers mind new growth numbers mind feel extent still slightly potential srinivas currently investment cycle really picking system banks borrowers undergoing time correcti time correction really mean banks faced stressed assets need maintain capital borrowers need delever given backdrop would made sense cut crr giving number say basis points would actually helped transmission liquidity perspective really cost funds perspective banks could actually compressed time correction ways actually tantamount backdoor recapitalization banking system could complemented rs crore budgeted could actually helped transmission line enquiry correct r thoughts dr urjit r patel think comparing apples bananas issue crr discussed morning basis points reduction crr would resulted basis points reduction lending rate think issue banks enough projects coming corporate leveraged ways issue tackled government’s increase investment announced budget investment gap ways filled cycle kick started respect roads railways power sector dr raghuram g rajan first think endorsing urjit’s point crr cuts miniscule basis points cut crr would release rs crore permanently system result barely basis points cut lending rates even pass clear also outset think talkin g orders magnitude difference crr understand market got enthused n fact irrelevance point far lending rates go think issue credit talking think sbi chairman today talked little bit credit growth picking view coal telecom obviously need credit auctions conducted good sign also look cmi e data came yesterday looks like investment starting pick early signs go town celebrating stalled projects coming investment intentions picking think starting see beginnings f investment cycle finally hope create enough new avenues purchasing assets liquefying highly leveraged players deleverage sell bring equity leverage comes way let us see abhay axis bank wanted ask reducing fixed rate overnight liquidity injection earlier also mean reducing overnight laf allow us dr raghuram g rajan think reduction overnight laf currently contemplated stay ndtl want keep readily accessible window fixed rate everything else moved market rate th e intention us providing additional liquidity need ensure rate close policy rate market rate close policy rate harish agarwal firstrand bank question regarding reverse repo since like operating reverse repo rate understand wpi around looking cpi comfortably sitting cpi may come going forward looking operate reverse repo going forward given point time dr raghuram g rajan hope mind saying second issue found little puzzling time around first crr people got sort gung ho second movement reverse repo move reverse repo today means operational rate market would move talking basis points cut policy rate smell coffee gu ys going cut interest rate basis points overnight policy rate today repo rate want bring rate cut policy rate given conditions cut p olicy rate whole suggestion moving reverse repo moving liquidity surplus pardon expression nuts samiran chakraborty standard chartered bank two questions related one monetary policy report projection cpi inflation august somewhat higher midpoint around policy statement sa id closer wondering whether subjective element induced model talk target august second built forecast cpi august number surprise affect monetary policy decision dr michael patra projection august really comes already know know today base effects right august allow cpi inflation ease projection show wonder separ ate projection show come market participants seem suggest favo urable base effects take rise samiran chakraborty looking projection cpi inflation monetary policy report midpoint show august dr michael patra yes think need look carefully also policy extension policy shubhada rao yes bank wanting seek comments disconnect banks rbi perception comfortable liquidity clearly seems hampering transmission assessment believe seems disconnect comfortable liquidity banking system ’s perspective rbi’s perspective dr raghuram g rajan may well right disconnect perception let say think rbi’s perception comfortable liquidity done away windows could borrow amount liquidity fixed price result certain market players used finance windows findin g harder go raise money markets tried keep market rate close policy rate injecting sufficient amounts liquidity occasionally spikes example march st look volatility around policy rate substantially lower course would zero give unlimited ability borrow policy rate would go window borrow much wanted given want stop move towards market borrowing players think achieved fair amount consolidation narrowness movement market rates tend hug policy rate would say plenty liquidity market least short term liquidity hug policy rate also aspect long term liquidity much increase size balance sheet accommodate credit growth make n estimate nominal growth economy translates expansion size balance sheet year try maintain size growth balance sheet years determined primarily purchase government bonds years determined primarily purchase foreign exchange purchase substantial amounts foreign exchange beyond want grow balance sheet sort adj ust size balance sheet selling government bonds words sterilization basically think successful aspects clearly people talk may think differently shubhada rao would certain sense visibility liquidity going forward medium long term short liquidity maybe banking system whole would feel confident lowering rates dr raghuram g rajan ultimately banks ake call primary source borrowing c annot primary source borrowing windows cannot primary source financial system finances murmurs banks somebod puts money o’clock night cannot immediately turn around deposit adequate rate question management extended windows banks able redeploy money quite bit accommodate requests ultimately central bank cannot way banks manage liquidity find ways including sometimes taking clients ’ money giving appropriate interest rate comes o’clock night short term liquidity management sometimes source friction banks figure appropriate amount liquidity going offer clients always amount liquidity perfectly well manage balance sheets today think going persuade reduce lending rates offering liquidity amounts possibly mean going able offer ndtl ny circumstance windows past brought see reason reducing lending rates seems beside point real reason alpana killawala today’s conference call researchers analysts thank much joining thank governor dr raghuram g rajan thank moderator thank ladies gentlemen conclude conference thank joining us may disconnect lines

2024-02-08 Shaktikanta Das,edited transcript governor’s interview cnbc tv may cnbc tv central bankers centre action saviours economy ravages covid rapidly rollback inflation reserve bank india also first line defence country made position clear may th unexpected cycle rise rates inflation nevertheless per cent man hot seat rbi governor us governor thank much indeed sparing time us shaktikanta das thank cnbc tv looks like really coordinated synchronised action centre rbi may th policy saw bunch fuel prices fuel excise duty cuts sense inflation think get coveted per cent shaktikanta das first thing mentioned coordinated action must mention way see entered another phase coordinated action fiscal monetary authorities check inflation rbi taken number steps last two three months fact would say much earlier taking steps somehow certain sections market missed explain government taken action wheat intermediaries various kinds intermediaries raw materials course big one petrol diesel put together definitely sobering impact inflation going forward petrol diesel tax reductions announced week end rbi back drawing table fact drawing board almost every day rework numbers give numbers next mpc first week june cnbc tv reason im asking poll cnbc deviating poll economists dont see per cent mark coming till fourth quarter january march quarter looks like three quarters cpi per cent shaktikanta das october till quite distance away lets speculate point time could actions also intervening period today may five months left let us see plays cannot give number today working next mpc june right moment say inflation projection mind last year large professional forecasters number moves tandem rbi numbers som etimes lower sometimes higher cnbc tv distinctly higher sir last number per cent pre fuel cut average street per cent shaktikanta das ill tell last year rather year february gave per cent many people thought optimistic ask explain optimistic professional forecasters per cent subsequently moved per cent think professional forecasters around around maybe little per cent moving tandem rbi number give june without working numbers run mpc correct part give number cnbc tv let come interest rates rate hikes made speech monetary policy statement may read dr patra’s minutes seem give impression want come ie pre covid level quickly understood right want come say august shaktikanta das broadly right extent rbi would like raise rates next meetings next meeting least said minutes one reasons cycle meeting may want much stronger action june highly avoidable cannot cutting rates basis points basis points somet hing like numbers mentioning random numbers please dont misinterpret numbers cnbc tv said pre covid thats shaktikanta das precovid said larger context liquidity well interest rates read minutes carefully say pre covid talking growth terms pre covid levels talking liquidity terms pre covid levels also talking rates terms pre covid levels expectation rate hike brainer increase repo rates much able tell say may accurate cnbc tv patra’s statement said even reached neutral accommodation go pre covid level thats market clutching shaktikanta das lot discussions deliberations take place mpc come conclusion cnbc tv let come liquidity part mentioned want come back pre covid levels pre covid liquidity level say february january two half lakh crores surplus liquidity currency finance report says two half lakh crore liquidity inflation starts rising also something want get quickly two half lakh crore shaktikanta das explain said normalise liquidity conditions multi year time cycle press conference said multiyear could two years could three years extent going sort bringing liquidity depend evolving growth inflation dynamics part strategy second thing requirement liquidity adequacy liquidity different adequacy liquidity current year economy also growing business activities rebounding therefore moving figure position liquidity would like normalise liquidity remove overhang liquidity system move situation adequate credit available system meet prod uctive requirements economy support credit offtake credit offtake takes place part liquidity also gets absorbed therefore target eliminate overhang liquidity time period two three years time ensure adequate liquidity system cnbc tv overhang would probably one trillion rupees balance zero liquidity two half trillion rupees current currency finance report said could incre ase inflation thats wanted know greater hurry reach also hike crr well selling albeit small quantities nds government bonds liquidity draining steps therefore asking whether initial steps little faster shaktikanta das cant say intermittent intervention nds om market really liquidity sucking emanating many complex developments taking place market time time intervene various complexity factors liquidity withdrawal remember one earlier interventions said learning past experience want avoid li quidity trap dont want get chakravyooh situation without knowing exit route liquidity infusion tltro whatever sunset date example announced total liquidity support lakh cror es actual offtake lakh crores five lakh crores already returned rest seven lakh crore still continues system overnight sdf get back two lakh crore rest vrrr particular box therefore bring calibrated phased manner cnbc tv let come rates one minutes think ashima goyal said market’s pricing rate hikes excessive swap market pricing something like peak repo rates would see excessive shaktikanta das wont like comment swap markets momentum factors fact would expect swap markets overall market guided reserve banks statements actions let mention think las two years especially extremely stressful times covid pandemic sort compact rbi financial markets convergence thoughts many aspects able reach today recovery economic activity become steady gaining traction cnbc tv nevertheless inflation issue probably likelihood three quarters going per cent per cent market would want know looking rates one members monetary policy council speak need get positive real rates least zero real rates deeply negative per cent inflation running well seven deeply negative also think need return positive least zero real rates shaktikanta das inflation major area concern today major area interest everybody country let explain take little time perhaps normal two facts would like mention beginning number one interest rates almost every country today negative except perhaps russia brazil interest rates take advanced economy take negative territory second thing regard inflation target advanced economies example per cent usa per cent united kingdom per cent euro area per cent think except japan one country excess per cent india target per cent tolerance band goes per cent per cent analysts market say reached peak dont like comment depend many factors including action central bank taking government taking allow little time think perhaps pre empt many questions look inflation mandate target given rbi reserve bank india act dual target says maintain price stability keeping mind objective growth price stability per cent plus minus per cent either side keeping mind objective growth experienced deepest contraction economy first quarter covid set minus per cent economy year minus per cent years final number come st sense economy revived exceeded howsoever moderately exceeded pre pandemic level exceeded levels private consumption become entered positive territory private inves tment also showing signs improvement therefore primary target time focus growth bring back inflation sort tolerate inflation per cent intermittently period inflation spiked per cent one two occasions even touched per cent last year looking numbers inflation almost came per cent multiple occasions remember correctly january happened around april perhaps september october came per cent stopped calling due transitory factors supply side factors remain even dominant current inflation stopped calling transitory concluded going transitory entered calendar year fact question asked thought ill take opportunity clarify wider understanding questions asked referred earlier february mpc projection inflation stay optimistic ill tell per cent momentum inflation month month october onwards moderating food price inflation moderating appeared upply chain bottlenecks start easing easing covid supply side factors ease even february done stress tests done scenario analysis found even margin error basis points per cent assumed crude oil prices little gave us inflation around per cent fairly comfortable roadmap future inflation moderate war started february february everything changed april mpc took several decisive actions changed sequence priorities put inflation first growth next normalised laf corridor changed stance saying focusing withdrawal accommodation rate action rate action introduced sdf per cent reverse repo sdf per cent ie increase basis points basis points increase liquidity absorption rate resulted overnight call rates immediately going basis points rate action market everyone take note rate action month april think many people seem lost question sudden meeting sudden april rate action basis points overnight rates went basis points mpc print several new devel opments took place example fao world bank came food price index became clear food price inflation stay important statement mpc statement minutes comes days statement read said situation fast changing dynamic actions tailored accordingly think many read right dont know may announced cycle eting forgot particular bit statement stop cnbc tv well youve defended told whether want come positive real rates anytime soon shaktikanta das move towards soon depend evolving situation correct part fact possible also forecast soon situation dynamic example inflation metrics undergo change action timely action government cnbc tv governor spoke actions central government also taken actions going impact fiscal deficit possibly also current account deficit rise fiscal deficit possibly market borrowing think borrow looks like tax revenues given away extent three trillion rupees shaktikanta das cannot speak obviously behalf government worked finance ministry sufficiently long period time let say one one correlation increase government expenditure one head need additional borrowing al l figures keep moving throughout year move year please remember month may second month current financial year certain heads expenditure requirements go certain heads expenditure requirements absorption capacity go revenue also thing happen revenue show greater buoyancy fact revenue figures currently going recent experience gst direct taxes look robust sense government remains committed cannot really speak behalf government sense government maintain fiscal deficit target given budget able answer sense several discussions continuous process reserve bank governments say government would sort committed maintaining fiscal deficit cnbc tv even yields gone year chances government program picks credit offtake picks go even

marginal standing facility go ing yesterday’s responses markets overall commentary move came surprise many people expecting hike weight expectation basis points think bears explanation chose take aggressive stance thi nk go back may policy place decision co ntext look back inflation trajectory last year bit going ba ck perhaps first quarter two distinct phases fact analysis well documented macro money developments looked changing drivers inflation fact three phases describe terms two end headline rate certainly problem around measure core non food manufacturing component started stabilise second half around came little bit month otherwise around went november december context approach validated calibration approach dealing clearly visible inflationary pressures point ry strong ones reserve bank india july page period starting march done roughly basi points reinforced shift call rate bottom corridor top around basis points end october early november new factor entered equation saw veryvery sharp increase commodity prices translated different significantly higher trajectory inflation starting early took stock number factor taken consideration whether going persistent budget position would fiscal position would post budget taken account looked inflation traject ory early part going ahead felt new situation combination commodity prices persistently buoyant domestic demand resulti ng much higher rate inflation case previous year really motivation may action moved basis points hike previous cycle may statement indicated trajectory inflation basically said would remain close current level around fo r period time start moderate towards second half year result among things cumulative actions monetary policy commodity pr ices seen risk terms also prospect rising clearly inflation risk factored calculations may policy statement three months later somewhat different situation co mmodity prices course whole series global developments get lack time commodity prices specifically pattern ha changed somewhat still high much expectation continue harden sense gives us relief looking ahead th e pressure exert domestic inflation remain likely become worse second factor taken consideration state domestic demands clearly interest rate hike basis points must start cutting demand certainly seeing signs discussions prior policy point repeatedly made banks difficulty passing credit particularly new capital investment consumer durables real estate pointed difficulty interest ratesensitive sectors suggested rates reached point beginning impact demand whether enough transition quickly bring inflation rates demand side judgment make look carefully corp orate numbers full set results q whatever early results could get time policy q yes clear signs moderation margins wi th projects pricing power coming dramatic shift keeping current rate inflation mind keeping fact trajectory likely remain level plus period reserve bank india july page time felt best course action course conti nue may stance continue basis point hike look ahead see play ing clearly expect growth slow somewhat demand compre sses last year’s growth estimated today indications might revised upwards already started see discussion public discourse partly new industrial production series suggest industrial growth somewhat higher course year previously thought actually moving plus around us reflects fairly significant deceleration moderation gr owth fact start impact inflation inflation numbe r said start come around novemberdecember cumulative impact rate actions demand help commodity prices may reinforce start soften period said really ha control point would prudent assume remain somewhat hostile range going forward perhaps getting worse result see inflation starting starts trend move march end people ndicated might somewh higher think important much number march end us projection rather beginning part downw ard trajectory inflation course extended following year continue take number broad scenario entering decide time right review stance change stance esse ntially driven said guidance two factors ha ppening commodity prices happening domestic demand show signs allowing inflation start trend clearly would right time review stance think process high inflation trajectory co ntinue next months watch clearly stance remains point antiinflationary believe also clear set indicators look review let stop brief opening rema rks open qa joined course deputy governors dr chakrabarty mr sinha mr khan executive directors – deepak

standard chartered please go ahead mahrukh adajania good afternoon question priority sector guidelines banks may credit policy mention revamp ex isting guidelines expect clarification dr kc chakrabarty see said committee constituted pending existing guidelines continue committee appointed appointed week’s time report expected four months’ time mahrukh adajania okay won’t change till committee appointed dr k c chakrabarty absolutely dr subir gokarn going end committee’s appointment going end recommendations accepted mahrukh adajania okay thank moderator thank next question th e line kaushik das deutsche bank mumbai please go ahead kaushik das dr gokarn mentioned end march flation projection gave guidance rather end target important trajectory inflation come prob ably decide let decide change monetary policy stance regardi ng wondering possible rbi give average wpi inflation financial year rather giving end march target also given fact look nonf ood manufactured goods inflation closely proxy core inflation least possible give end march target core inflation well dr subir gokarn actually first question actually policy statement given explicitly give n monthly number fan chart actually compute stop us giving consider second yes think work progress obvi ously forecast internally careful subject significant errors case guidance becomes little misleading implicit headline number traditionally giving projections also core consistent trajectory publish clearly part internal analysis kaushik das one question industrial production index talked earlier governor also talked kind gives faulty indications reserve bank india july page times important industrial production growth number far policy decision concerned today dr subir gokarn one input several said occasi ons perhaps audience sets inputs decision data models forecasts come series surveys including surveys companies industrial outlook su rvey referred mmd macro monetary developments doc ument well capacity utilisation survey order book inventory capacity utilisation cr edit conditions survey survey bank officials consu ltations whole range stakeholders try triangulate inputs try arrive picture consistent inference consistent largest number indicators get information iip important one recognise ar e limitations reject entirely see context hearing seeing indicators well kaushik das thank moderator thank next question line shubhada rao yes bank mumbai please go ahead shubhada rao thank good afternoon everyone act ually two questions th e first question regarding core inflation trend recent months think volatile times incremental data assumed larger significance seen clear trend q fy q either month month deseas onalised adjusted seen sharp drop one point average q fy monthovermonth trend core index even look seasonally adjusted come sharply lower reading much trend see comment latest core inflation monthovermonth sequential pa tterns reserve bank india statement would like hear thoughts one second academic question perhaps looking incipient signs moderation quantum hikes seen last months bps carry potential risk seeing growth going well comfort levels essentially quantum rate hike store large dose hike amidst oderating cycle one see risks growth spiralling lower fa ster anticipated two questions panel thank deepak mohanty shubhada think difficult really derive substantive conclusion looking happened q know th one month final data two months provisional data past ha seen substantial revision provisional data happening ca n see april nonfood manufacturing final data provision al gone really one compares reserve bank india july page q gives impression nonfood manufacturing really picked end march add together extent obviously show pattern clear deceleration one sure taken caution kind time series exercise end point data also creates problem give kind false number see momentum come see pr ovisional final year april uptrend let us hope moderates assumption moderation take place extent moderation need ascertain dr subir gokarn second question important indicated opening remarks fact signs moderation much evidence discussions stakeholders lead dilemma whether go stronger hike versus lower one think really worked favour stronger hike essentially robustness several components demand fact low interestsensitivity example consumption indications quite buoyant course ar e components interestsensitive seem showing signs moderation otherwise great signs secondly even ongoing fiscal consolidation process still significant contribution dema nd coming public expenditure know result crisis response substantially higher today crisis seen steady improvement fisc al situation hose two components essentially quite robust fiscal situation adjusting still quite strong given felt downside risk growth interest rate hikes would fairly bounded whereas upside risks inflation pa rticularly perception number action seen adequa te course people l expected mean everybody thought right thing predicting action making judgment opt imal thought stronger action essentially consistent new stance signalled may course downside risk growth pointed document indicated range think grow th may go end day also think strong lower bound risk whereas inflation risk unfortunately upward bound unbounded many ways may play balance risks favour going little aggressively inflation shubhada rao thank moderator thank next question lin e srinivas varadarajan credit suisse singapore please go ahead srinivas varadarajan would like thank panel taking questions two que stions first one goes follows one looks inflation expectations survey publish every quarter numbers th e average oneyear forward inflation reserve bank india july page expectations since september close around since october actually shifted policy shifte policy emphasises cycle average oneyear forward expectation close last published number period jan march oneyear forward ex pectation point try make seems alluded fiscal offsets monetary policy action fiscal impulse large advance tax refunds nrega indexation msp one course taking account anticipated food security act point policies welcome welfare perspective side effect terms keeping structural inflation inflation expectations high one reasons actually keep gr owth forecast upping yearend inflation forecast despite monetary po licy action basis points cycle also seems expectations real ly sensitive policy actions taken far kind point towa rds basically wage price spiral significant risk first question th e second question real rate india one takes sbi base rate quarter oneyear forward inflation expectations real rate still negative basis points would respond dr subir gokarn think first question put lo weight fact survey odd respondents inflation expectat ions surveyed cut across range socio economic categories relativel high weight high proportion people food largest single item household expenditure far true daily waged labourers selfemployed people formal sector kind relatively small proportion people whitecollar professionals could say recent experience food impact inflation expectations think playing significant role expectations moving certainly pay lot attention terms directionality wh ich point mentioned movement something important suggests people starting see inflation rising much terms actual number really weighted outcome sample composition think put caveats broader point expectations possibility translating wage demand think relevant read mmd towards end document introduced discussion wage dynamics significant obviously significant bargaining power many labour market segments translating heard anecdotally showing aggregate data well large wage increases ability index even implicit contracts informal market transactions quite high high expectations rising expectations certainly enhance risk spiral emerging recall one statements made macro money developments document need focus dealing wage price dynamics important issue dealing expectations even translate dire ctly household let us keep mind wage twosided contract whether worker asking wage employer reserve bank india july page willing give one similar expectations terms inflation able agree mutually acceptable inflation premium employers feeling pinch talking po ssibility moderation premium may forthcoming counterva iling force side even monetary policy showing indivi dual household expectations clearly impact potential employer wil ling pay given assessment business prospects transmission terms second question think fer back issue response previous question see much directly explicitly said clearly still significant role fiscal public spending playing demand terribly interestsensitive long continues adjustment ongoing ministry finan ce clearly laid year timeframe fiscal consolidation even ongoing still pl aying large role demand keeps pressure demand regardless monetary policy actions taken along consideratio ns feel demand quite robust good reasons example priv ate consumption spending also part reason decided stay take factors also taken consideration may policy di feel adequate ground sharply bring growth forecast emphasise we’ve given range mid point range deepak would like add deepak mohanty supplement terms inflation expectations survey dg clarified household survey much cannot read time horizon increases one year line mostly happens adaptive expectations expectations formed learning unless people see ground level prices coming change expectat ion much going think useful thing see current inflation three months line accurate terms validation subsequent kind data see inflation comes oneyear inflation expectation also coming think best way read inflation expectations main anchored quite relevant srinivas varadarajan question real rate take sbi base rate quarter oneyear forward inflation expectation may month forward closer dr subir gokarn think make distinction effective rate inflation person borrowing base rate relevant rate inflation business person wpi whole core component wpi cpi… think defining…real in… taking two numbers necessarily link think appropriate take wpi lending rates deposit rates also positive real point policy rate clearly lending deposit rates broadly reserve bank india july page srinivas varadarajan thank moderator thank next question line manvinder singh international institution studies please go ahead manvinder singh question panel rise policy rates created arbitrage opportunity interest rate di fferential bring foreign inflow country wanted know one thing rise inflows one hand lead appreciation exchange rate first question rbi allow appreciation exchange rate secondly allow incr ease foreign exchange reserves move rbi allows increased appreciation exchange rate rbi think lead lowering imported inflation dr sabir gokarn first question polic position intervene forex market objective determining setting exchange rate extent intervene done lot time essentially react sharp volatility rate determination mind exchange rate essentially market determined within broad contours capital controls debt flows inflow result interest rate arbitrage seeing point large inflow default response would let currency appreciate let market determine exchange rate would case significant accumulation reserves rupee appreciate yes obviously everything else remaining positive impact inflation extent imports become cheaper also contractionary sense exports become less competitive aggreg ate demand goes helps contain demand therefore bring inflation really matter magnitude happened last several months th rate fairly variable capital inflows much larger current account deficit much change exchange rate overall hypothetical situation yes would help deal appreciation reality even relatively open capital account point rupee moves tw directions moving distinctly one direction manvinder singh sir second question rbi says huge demand aggregate demand aggregate supply huge liquidity present economy think instead moving basis points rise repo reverse repo rate would good something would done crr front repo reverse repo would raised basis points dr subir gokarn yeah interesting point think distinguish notion liquidity referring broa der sense sort large buoyant demand economy talk liquidity talking reserve bank india july page resources available financial system basis expand credit typically banks would need liquidity support crr cash reserve ratio context liquidity actually deficit consistently since end may given see significant benefit using crr certainly tighten situation could also disrupt normal business activity banks availability cost liquidity become unpredictable since deficit already transmission policy rates actual lending rates quite strong saw yesterday soon polic many banks announced least thought two three banks announced ba se rate hike also roughly basis points transmi ssion quite strong impact seek achieve manvinder singh thank moderator thank next question lin e devika mendirat ta credit suisse singapore please go ahead devika mendiratta hi good afternoon thank much taking question question relates charts real interest rates quarterly macro publication released day totally take point let us look particular value real interest rates right flation rates use right like got chart showi ng banks lending rates real terms stated using wpi found interesting starting trend clearly downwards real rates actually fallen starting pretty much consecutively someone w ould look might say real rates seem low trend basis compared historical trend hence stimulative wondering thoughts please thank deepak mohanty yeah various calculations given absolutely right terms trend one looks secular decline real interest rate one really looks suppose take high growth phase calculations real interest rate could range around obviously quite lower stage course one factor one would take decade inflation rate also remained high couple years dr subir gokarn think important devika look structural changes financial changes taken place period time sure trend indication whether policy stimulatory contractionary revealing think seen course cycle period time keep mind onwards sign ificant changes financial sector including think slr brought don’t remember moved reserve bank india july page change was… small savings rate brought substantial change series deregulations market also clearly impacted trend think looking longterm necessarily give indication state policy think appropriately se en cycle devika mendiratta right thanks moderator thank next question th e line peckwee yeo rbs singapore please go ahead peckwee yeo hi good afternoon one quick question rbi actually see estimate trend growth potential growth economy dr subir gokarn use word ‘trend’ ‘poten tial’ bit semantic confusion public debate ‘potential ’ seen aspirational number prefer use word ‘trend’ asse ssment communicated mmd macro monetary development docum ent may chance look around peckwee yeo right trend growth would fiscal year ending going beyond particular trend growth rbi looking see somewhat non inflationary dr subir gokarn saying business usual trend essentially non inflationary sustain period time year period time without inflatio nary pressures becoming acute course raise requires bunch vestments repeatedly referred supply response concerns food infras tructure seeing pressure wages human capital skill ssue number constraints need addressed take trend rate growth higher business usual scenario clearly recent experience would suggest grow th rate significantly higher period time start see inflationary pressures becoming quite significant sort broad perhaps reasonable benchmark work peckwee yeo thank moderator thank next question lin e shishir shindekar byk college commerce nasik pl ease go ahead shishir shindekar thank good afternoon sir thanks organising event regularly shishir shindekar nasik reserve bank india july page dr subir gokarn hi shishir shishir shindekar question kind correlation observed repo rate rate inflation wpi well real gdp last three years specifically much time normally require transmission mechanism change monetary variables su ch repo rate change real economy thank sir deepak mohanty would see transmission quite st rong money market soon rates change see money market rates adjusting pretty quickly little slower debt market goes credit market late seen transmission credit market al quite good base rate system coming place less corresponding increase es taking place lending rate research would suggest pol icy instrument impact ultimate variables growth inflation lag assessment would suggest something year months kind lags terms policy instruments know lags variable depends structure economy moves moderator thank next question line varda pande birla mutual fund mumbai please go ahead varda pande hi good afternoon question actually timing aggression clamp inflation three tr iggers actually pointed may policy fuel price hike expected msp hike expected persistence nonfood manufacturing inflation terms expe ctations three counts scored high even may th june may two look nonfood manufacturing inflation trajectory february may well one concern play ed fuel price hike expected midjune done little later th point three triggers actually came june midquarter really kind aggression shown yesterday could shown june policy may expectations could come wh guidance march ’ number inflation opt june policy dr subir gokarn keep mind six weekly cyclical much less intense process midquarter think five quarters started midquarter intensity process quarterly describe previous response draw data model forecast company numbers company results conversations su rveys come us six weekly frequency sixweek ly review essentially based data releases two data release come quarterly policy th iip numbers reserve bank india july page wpi numbers also usual financia l data credit deposits little difficult course new process getting entrenched take might sort risky action basis relatively limited inputs although result difficulty cha llenges communication think choice june say look may think momentum still stance continues let us move aggre ssively might basis comprehensive set inputs got th e usual quarterly process really question much new information mu ch analysis information therefore ability little confident appropriateness decision varda pande understand reaction let us say procedural quarterly data inflow instead incrementally see daily basis dr subir gokarn sure follow saying th sounds right based two new sets two months data coming midquarter trying see whether reinforces quarterly assessment challenge us somewhat varda pande right right thank much moderator thank next question line parul saini rbs securities singapore please go ahead parul saini good afternoon thanks taking questi two questions actually one regarding core manufacturi ng inflation realise mentioned earlier numbers may june provisional put much faith seasonally adjusted trend show significant deceleration versus trend earlier calendar year look going forward even seasonally adjusted trend within rbi’s comfort zone yearoveryear core manufacturing inflation number would stay pretty high even december around given said tightening stance comes core manufacturing inflation goes significantly might helpful fo r us know matrix would looking closely would year overyear number impacted base affect could stay high even seasonally adjusted number coming also talked corporate pricing power regarding core manufacturing inflation expectations earlier results suggest lot margin compression coming thought ou think appropriate margin compression industrial companies seen significant margin compression two questions core manufacturing infl ation second question financial stability review points higher interest rates ar e significant risk asset quality even higher gdp slowdown given rate hikes reserve bank india july page come system think significantly threatening asset quality good get views thanks dr subir gokarn well first question although typi cally frame policy statements yearon year number process certainly review monthonmonth quarteron quarter adjusted numbers well ge sense momentum would discovered would go back months significant upward revision final numbers provisional actua lly resulted significant change picture one gets analysis one view degree rejected something place overall dash board one input clearly ther e evidence momentum dramatically changing well previous questioner raised issues momentum something keeping track put number think would difficult perhaps even appropriate think really question whether pattern consistent l ooking number going go mean going go pricing power gone going go overall demand gone see consistency corporate numbers production num bers price numbers see sort everything things pointing r oughly direction think gives us confidence trend underway base decision margin compression would say thin g made statement policy see significant certainly see compression significant suggest th early results odd companies friday policy analysed perhaps middle august full set analysis done review margin dynamics earnings dynamics input mid quarter going forward get early results q october statement ongoing process really ch ange break pattern keen see really necessarily numerical benchmar k keep mind established history relatively new recent inputs coming policy making process parul saini second question interest rate dr k c chakrabarty yeah see asset quality definite ly deteriorates rise interest rates financial stability report indicating interest rate brought asset quality otherwise deteriorate cautioning banks risk manageme nt monitoring system credit quality vigorous increase interest rate deterioration asset quality least partly risk mitigated quite sure enough gap risk manageme nt practices monitoring credit quality followup recovery efforts need accelerated cannot say reserve bank india july page increase interest rate asset quality deteriorates economy requires control inflation want increase interest rate done purpose different regarding financ ial stability warn system risk action taken parul saini sure clarify given expressedly said wait core manufacturing inflation come sustaina bly would numeric number mind looking septem ber october let us say monthonmonth manufacturing inflation come ye aroveryear numbers stay high see demand slowdown also margin compressed take reasons enough monetary policy stance change dr subir gokarn well september midquarter october quarterly clearly indicating give appropriate guidance statements parul saini thank moderator thank next question line pradeep mamak citibank mumbai please go ahead badri yeah name badri citibank c ouple specific questions specifically coming quarter policy fi rst question growth guidan ce sure percentage interest sensitive sector overall gdp services exports continue remain buoyant headline gdp within trend saying ignoring what’s happeni ng interest sensitive sectors continue antiinflationary stance second question inflation talked possible spike food fuel inflation coming months next policy stance precisely guided nonfood manufacturing inflation third question fiscal talk ed quite bit fiscal issues considered specific impact monetary actions nd sacrificing growth nearterm immediate fiscal situation revenue side dr subir gokarn well first question relation composition output think whatever scenario visualise growth emerges whatever composition sectoral activity drives significant decline broad category sectors one somewhere fairly quickly see profits earnings coming sector margins compressed also result lower pricing power pricing coming tracking components contribut ors inflation pick terms link real activity translating corporate numbers actual inflation numbers think looking numbers isolation looking terms eventually reflect terms reserve bank india july page trying bring inflation going drivers process second question respect spike quite get second question badri yeah talking food fuel price inflation could possibly go due msp reasons next policy guidance action going precisely based nfm food fuel etc dr subir gokarn clearly linkage first round sh ocks transmission larger inflation process going drive thinking sorry third one – badri fiscal dr subir gokarn oh yeah important point look tax buoyancy issue clearly base indirect taxes nominal gdp actual mix growth inflation important getting overa budget estimate don’t think would much shortfall indirect taxes direct ta xes may see compression earnings going may impact also ongoing process tax administrativ e improvements better monitoring better collections may actually offset think growth inflation numbers table although curre ntly slightly differ ent finance ministry direct bearing aspect may ot reasons fiscal slippage highlighted statements revenue accrual basis think much worry badri thanks moderator thank next question line soumyajit niyogi sbi please go ahead soumyajit niyogi yeah good afternoon soumyajit niy ogi sbi dfhi dr gokarn would like ask last policy seen growth reduced spite low money supply achieved deposit growth liquidity required antiinflationary stance would like continue low money supply deepak mohanty essentially antiinflationary stance would control liquidity alongside th would seen also credit projection also have… soumyajit niyogi second thing since yield curve ha flattened significantly sign longend curve hardened significantl say borrowing would mostly long end curve compared short end already reserve bank india july page government announced continue cash management bills obviously tbills continue dr subir gokarn mr khan address question mr khan cash management bills shortterm treasury bills basically meant shortterm capital mismatches meant fo r longterm requirements government far longterm requirement concerned fairly welldistributed allocation securities shortterm mediumterm nd longterm taking advantage flattening curve strategy compar atively increase size longterm strategy continues soumyajit niyogi okay thank alpana killawala take last two questions mellissa moderator sure next question lin e manish wadhawa n hsbc mumbai please go ahead manish wadhawan good afternoon would like seek vi ews trajectory monetary policy tightening basically whole idea since monetary policy tightening happened started nond irect approach slr hike seen basis points hi ke point time concern regarding kind slowdown talks moderation growth gone ahead basis points june basis points yesterday policy dr subir gokarn basis points may manish wadhawan may yeah basis pointsif could throw light factors existed talk wage pressures core inflation commodities firming could suggest gone dr subir gokarn think look three phase right listen introductory remark manish wadhwa yeah sure dr subir gokarn talking different trajectory th inflation important part explanation go back one step look exit prices also looking wh ere started particular cycle tightening remember st art normal situation started sort desperate situation driven crisis effective call rate reserve bank india july page started process two processes running parallel essentially correction process normalisation process also bit tightening reflecting inflationary forces seeing emerging economy year begin would refer discussion mmd first phase inflationary process driven food point obviously view food prices going amenable monetary policy need deal expectati issue justify tightening point normalisation tightening goi ng time started look phase two roughly july novemberdecember inflation actually started moderating headline came core contributing mainly nonfood primary products contributing one phase sort ended end early new shock commodity prices shock factor rising th ey significant today commodity prices even softening last weeks still higher year ago completely different inflation trajectory emerging early part responding aggressive actions think one see th logically continuous cycle two distinct breaks cycle one normalisation two recent shock terms global commodity price factor manish wadhawan appreciate thank much moderator thank last question line shubra mittal kotak mahindra mumbai please go ahead shubra mittal good afternoon question really talking right assumption normal monsoon wondering case monsoon fail would implications growth inflation upside risk inflation materialising downside risk growth also materialising simultaneously situation possibly could stance rbi dr subir gokarn moment since find analysis rainfall july really critical monsoon risk july fa r country production weighted index food production weighted ndex looking slightly normal ri sk significantly actually ab ated risk august july failure question would gained lot significance comfort fro july numbers august becomes inadequate yes crops affected obviously take consideration moment monsoon risk somewhat less significant would say significantly less significant went may cycle idea temporal distribution rainfall would july performance reassuring mo less nationwide food reserve bank india july page grain production weighted index see serious stresses emerging food structural issues talking impacting food prices added burden bad monsoon unl ikely part story shubra mittal thank dr subir gokarn going bring close th ank participating appreciate questions asked
