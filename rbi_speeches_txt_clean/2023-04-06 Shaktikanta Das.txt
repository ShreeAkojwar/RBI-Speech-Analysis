question regarding inflation index ed bonds current level cpi wpi inflation index ed bonds quoted deep discounts market factoring fall inflation henceforth shri hrkhan actually issued inflation index ed bond think around outstanding could follow subsequent issuances inflation trajectory gone different direction deep discounts discussion government revised version inflation index ed bond institutional investor well retail investor let us see new thing comes possibly could consider take care illiquid inflation index ed bond whether switching take view kumar rachapudi anz bank two questions one liquidity conditions mentioned view quite flush look indicators like either reserve money even incremental credit deposit ratio right th e last months versus ldr ratio overall banks obviously daily basis notwithstanding fact deposit ing money term reverse repos rbi still net borrowers central bank wondering thinking liquidity conditions accommodative second question sterilization f x inflows rbi probably look f x month implied yields around much higher overnight rate think way sterilizing prohibiting corporate hedging f x liabilities considering ways sterilization dr raghuram g rajan first question think looking overly march numbers liquidity generally tight look forward see happens liquidity unwinds forward looking perspective saying plenty l iquidity market second question far forward premium goes intervene take account various issues including size premia etc deciding might effective way intervene said f act premia sometimes push variety reasons intervention example credit tight arbitrage leg create synthetic forward may difficult may therefore imply higher premium otherwise wo uld treat expansion premium primarily rbi intervention could variety reasons kumar rachapudi sir following question liquidity assessment see banks borrowing le us say may june april presuming increased government spending borrowing slightly lower numbers march according projections numbers may june dr michael patra lot contingent factors economy let us say economy goes turning point moves obviously little excess demand liquidity let us say less agricultur al activity mons oon turn favourable see completely different roll liquidity may june early forecast liquidity june many imponderables exist today imran ayed aegon religare question probably partly answered related inflation index ed bonds good looking forward issuing cpi linked inflation index ed bonds start visibility last time around bonds issued people created products around inflation index ed bonds bonds longer issued issue cpi linked bonds could give us roadmap certainty issued future develop certain products certain business case around inflation index ed bonds provide customers real hedge inflation also business case us dr raghuram g rajan good suggestion certainly k eep mind aastha g udwani birla sun life asset management sir one question three conditions spirit actually four laid one condition accommodative monetary policy stance going forward point conditions take least may longer months terms shaping impact decipher next policy rate move actually deferred time four conditions met dr raghuram g rajan sure say conditions met seems mind numerical something clear yes condition think conditions reflecting kinds things would like see movement precisely much something look compositely looking happening including information comes would ascribe threshold number conditions say falls x action forthcoming composite big picture going look put elements play longer time announcements made likely happen also give us sense composite picture aastha g udwani sir would allow one point talking example impact transmissions front loaded rate cuts supply response inputs power land announcements intention things happen rbi going look next action dr raghuram g rajan trying get precise saying look elements develop composite sense obviously transmission take place much likely sort prospects happening things wil l gauge determining make next move want precise saying elements need look anjali verma phillip capital two questions one talk real interest rates looking repo interest rate looking deposit rate second question although understand rbi largely targeting focused achieving cpi targets right completely ignoring wpi isinflation underway dr raghuram g rajan far real interest rate goes thus far talking risk free real interest rate indian context typically would mean look forward cpi something like repo rate minus look forward cpi would good definition working definition think real interest rate far wpi goes clearly issue number look form going international forces effect wpi well corporate pressures often number indicates extent corporate pricing power corporate input cost gives us sense corporate see inflation different say citizen element thinking target cpi wpi naveen sharma hdfc life two questions one fiscal consolidation path saying government deleveraging path going fiscal consolidation path private sector see idprivate also deleveraging path banks able lend big ticket size ca pital cons trained talking psu banks constitute total book fii limits opened whatever corporate bond fii limits precisely money going pfcs one question whe n economy picks going fund growth dr raghuram g rajan good question economy picks alert funding constraints see starkly see certainly alert think government also alert perhaps capital needs psu banks let us see room banks bring especially psus access markets raise capital markets also government psus market access make case need capital sure point capital forthcoming government position right mean thinking active discussion going government things naveen sharma sir one question wpi cpi ha answered stark difference fuel inflation wpi cpi core reason used close last three four readings rbi looking think difficult get composition cpi right way data collected obviously series old rbi looking also headline number core number go ing dr michael patra petrol eum import reflected wpi reflected cpi fuel households consume fuel category find really firewood electricity prices determining evolution fuel category motor fuels households use transport communication cpi difference wpi cpi watch closely srinivas deutsche bank sir one square forecast inflation growth end year backdrop flexible inflation targeting really look one applies basically monetary policy rule forecast inflation growth one square stance guidance given dr raghuram g rajan basically think hint ing measure potential growth plug figure going tell whether consistent stance right think wh michael talked earlier course admit still trying understand new cso numbers somewhat constrained project growth based new numbers understand well thought understood old numbers may se em michael said determining potential growth easy short series data creates little bit noise feel fairly comfortable stance given think us old growth numbers mind new growth numbers mind feel extent still slightly potential srinivas currently investment cycle really picking system banks borrowers undergoing time correcti time correction really mean banks faced stressed assets need maintain capital borrowers need delever given backdrop would made sense cut crr giving number say basis points would actually helped transmission liquidity perspective really cost funds perspective banks could actually compressed time correction ways actually tantamount backdoor recapitalization banking system could complemented rs crore budgeted could actually helped transmission line enquiry correct r thoughts dr urjit r patel think comparing apples bananas issue crr discussed morning basis points reduction crr would resulted basis points reduction lending rate think issue banks enough projects coming corporate leveraged ways issue tackled government’s increase investment announced budget investment gap ways filled cycle kick started respect roads railways power sector dr raghuram g rajan first think endorsing urjit’s point crr cuts miniscule basis points cut crr would release rs crore permanently system result barely basis points cut lending rates even pass clear also outset think talkin g orders magnitude difference crr understand market got enthused n fact irrelevance point far lending rates go think issue credit talking think sbi chairman today talked little bit credit growth picking view coal telecom obviously need credit auctions conducted good sign also look cmi e data came yesterday looks like investment starting pick early signs go town celebrating stalled projects coming investment intentions picking think starting see beginnings f investment cycle finally hope create enough new avenues purchasing assets liquefying highly leveraged players deleverage sell bring equity leverage comes way let us see abhay axis bank wanted ask reducing fixed rate overnight liquidity injection earlier also mean reducing overnight laf allow us dr raghuram g rajan think reduction overnight laf currently contemplated stay ndtl want keep readily accessible window fixed rate everything else moved market rate th e intention us providing additional liquidity need ensure rate close policy rate market rate close policy rate harish agarwal firstrand bank question regarding reverse repo since like operating reverse repo rate understand wpi around looking cpi comfortably sitting cpi may come going forward looking operate reverse repo going forward given point time dr raghuram g rajan hope mind saying second issue found little puzzling time around first crr people got sort gung ho second movement reverse repo move reverse repo today means operational rate market would move talking basis points cut policy rate smell coffee gu ys going cut interest rate basis points overnight policy rate today repo rate want bring rate cut policy rate given conditions cut p olicy rate whole suggestion moving reverse repo moving liquidity surplus pardon expression nuts samiran chakraborty standard chartered bank two questions related one monetary policy report projection cpi inflation august somewhat higher midpoint around policy statement sa id closer wondering whether subjective element induced model talk target august second built forecast cpi august number surprise affect monetary policy decision dr michael patra projection august really comes already know know today base effects right august allow cpi inflation ease projection show wonder separ ate projection show come market participants seem suggest favo urable base effects take rise samiran chakraborty looking projection cpi inflation monetary policy report midpoint show august dr michael patra yes think need look carefully also policy extension policy shubhada rao yes bank wanting seek comments disconnect banks rbi perception comfortable liquidity clearly seems hampering transmission assessment believe seems disconnect comfortable liquidity banking system ’s perspective rbi’s perspective dr raghuram g rajan may well right disconnect perception let say think rbi’s perception comfortable liquidity done away windows could borrow amount liquidity fixed price result certain market players used finance windows findin g harder go raise money markets tried keep market rate close policy rate injecting sufficient amounts liquidity occasionally spikes example march st look volatility around policy rate substantially lower course would zero give unlimited ability borrow policy rate would go window borrow much wanted given want stop move towards market borrowing players think achieved fair amount consolidation narrowness movement market rates tend hug policy rate would say plenty liquidity market least short term liquidity hug policy rate also aspect long term liquidity much increase size balance sheet accommodate credit growth make n estimate nominal growth economy translates expansion size balance sheet year try maintain size growth balance sheet years determined primarily purchase government bonds years determined primarily purchase foreign exchange purchase substantial amounts foreign exchange beyond want grow balance sheet sort adj ust size balance sheet selling government bonds words sterilization basically think successful aspects clearly people talk may think differently shubhada rao would certain sense visibility liquidity going forward medium long term short liquidity maybe banking system whole would feel confident lowering rates dr raghuram g rajan ultimately banks ake call primary source borrowing c annot primary source borrowing windows cannot primary source financial system finances murmurs banks somebod puts money o’clock night cannot immediately turn around deposit adequate rate question management extended windows banks able redeploy money quite bit accommodate requests ultimately central bank cannot way banks manage liquidity find ways including sometimes taking clients ’ money giving appropriate interest rate comes o’clock night short term liquidity management sometimes source friction banks figure appropriate amount liquidity going offer clients always amount liquidity perfectly well manage balance sheets today think going persuade reduce lending rates offering liquidity amounts possibly mean going able offer ndtl ny circumstance windows past brought see reason reducing lending rates seems beside point real reason alpana killawala today’s conference call researchers analysts thank much joining thank governor dr raghuram g rajan thank moderator thank ladies gentlemen conclude conference thank joining us may disconnect lines
