seen context regulatory approaches nbfc sector coming regulatory approach nbfc sector framing regulations financial sector reserve bank always conscious fact degree regulation financial entity httpswwwrbiorginscriptspublicationreportdetailsaspxurlpageid commensurate perception risks posed entity scale operations financial system ur regulatory approach towards nbfc sector guided combination activity based entity based regulations safeguard financial stability protect customers tried leverage strengths approaches achieve comprehensive flexible regulatory framework find hybrid approach particularly valuable ever evolving nbfc sector innovations new business models seem constantly emerging entity bas ed r egulations advantage provid ing comprehensive view overall risk exposure specific financial institution better placed address systemic risks arising interplay various activities within single entity minimise negative externalities regulator’s perspective entity based regulations generally easier implement enforce regulations applied uniformly set entities however flip side entity based regulations may less precise targeting specific activities slower adapt changing landscape times may potentially impos e extra burden low risk activities hand ctivity based regulations allow precise targeting potentially risky financial activities enabling regulators focus high risk activities regardless type institution involved potential side approach could result fragmented regulatory landscape different rules various activities potentially making oversight complex times systemic risks arising combination multiple activities may remain undetected advocated ideally principle risk activity regulation apply ie similar regulation entities undertaking similar activity avoid regulatory arbitrage saying goes f looks like duck quacks like duck acts like duck probably duck regulated duck however approach needs calibrated suitably effective yet non stifling regulations instead following narrow approach putting place set regulations financial institutions irrespective scale operations nuanced approach may suitable achiev ing desired objectives cognizant fact nbfcs engage speciali sed activities carrying unique risks flexibility inherent hybrid model enabled us adapt swiftly changes sector without sacrificing overarching systemic risk management inherent entity based regulati ons keeping balance mind regulatory approach evolved two broad categories – prudential regulations conduct business regulations prudential regulation focusses solvency safety soundness financial entities overall financial system conduct business regulation focusses financial entities deal customers fair business practices current regulatory landscape combination entity activity based approaches pillars prudential conduct regulations let cite recent regulations nbfc sector wherein tried maintain balance different regulatory approaches • first case point would like mention peer peer lending platforms nbfc pps since nbfc pps undertak e credit risk merely acting meeting place lenders borrowers prudential regulations nbfc pps kept light basic entry level requirements hand lenders nbfc pps trust platforms getting know borrowers avail additional services kyc authentication credit scoring legal formalities recovery assistance etc therefore conduct norms platforms kept par regulated entities financial sector • second example icrofinance sector microfinance loans small sized loans constitutes small share overall credit therefore probability financial stability concerns emanating microfinance loans quite low however terms numbers microfinance loans affect large number borrowers borrowers belong vulnerable categor therefore becomes necessary regulatory approach microfinance loans specifically targeted protect interests borrowers objective customer protection mind entity agnostic activity based comprehensive regulatory framework microfinance loans put place microfinance loans provided regulated entities • third example r egulatory framework infrastructure debt fund nbfcs idfnbfcs recently reviewed regulatory framework idf nbfcs wherein regulatory guidelines activity infrastructure financing harmonised extent possible categories nbfcs engaged infrastructure financing accordingly withdrawn requirement sponsor idfnbfcs aligned regulatory capital requirement exposure norms nbfc ifcs nbfc iccs middle layer approach allows harmonis ation regulations applicable infrastructure financing nbfcs preserving unique low risk character idf nbfcs upper layer nbfcs regulated par banks coming specific issues pertaining nbfc sector let discuss two pert inent issues first reports discussions regulations nbfcs especially nbfcs upper layer made par banks would like take opportunity set record straight matter agreed regulations banks nbfcs harmonised areas regulations certain nbfcs especially upper layer nbfcs strengthened sbr framework significant differences continue exist regulations applicable banks nbfcs would like highlight emphasize • minimum initial capital requirement universal bank ₹ crore visàvis ₹ crore nbfc also scrutiny banking license applicant much rigorous scrutiny nbfc license applicant primarily reflect access public deposits throgh bank license provide perspective may perhaps pertinent mention rbi provided certificate registration nbfcs last five years whereas nbfc infrastructure finance companies nbfc ifcs nbfc investment credit companies nbfc iccs universal bank license given small finance banks sfbs given licenses period • second major difference banks cannot engage activities specifically provided banking regulation act w hereas provision rbi act governing nbfcs’ regulations also banks required deploy minimum adjusted net bank credit towards priority sector lending requirement even higher sfbs nbfcs requirements • sometimes also argued regulatory capital requirement nbfcs higher vis àvis banks however needs noted banks ’ capital requirement comprises credit market operational risk capital charges whereas nbfcs including nbfc upper layer capital requirement based credit risk capital charge even components regulatory capital elaborately prescribed case banks • almost regulatory restrictions operations nbfcs commercial b anks hand subjected detailed branch authorization policy prescribing manner open branches corresponding guidelines nbfcs including nbfcs ul nutshell would like emphasize regulations nbfcs especially upper layer much calibrated certainly par regulations applicable banks nbfcs allowed accept deposits econd issue would like discuss regarding deposit taking activity nbfcs perception sbr framework made regulations nbfcs bank like also intermittent demands nbfcs allowed accept public deposits clarified first issue let emphasize indeed non acceptance public deposits nbfcs provides regulatory comfort reserve bank lower entry barriers nbfcs allow specialise specific sector choice lower exit barriers wind business es acceptance deposit whatever manner form necessitates existence macro financial safety net including deposit insurance central bank liquidity backstop safety nets come increased regulatory rigour intense supervisory oversight nbfcs evolved niche companies serving specific economic function uncharacteristic demand becom ing like bank considering reserve bank issued certificate registration new nbfcs acceptance public deposits since contrary reserve bank’s approach disincentivise deposit taking activities nbfcs evident decrease number deposit taking nbfcs last decade march september concerns expectations nbfc sector h come long way since initial days regulatory framework nbfc sector aided development providing operational flexibility proportionate regulations however certain risks horizon would like use forum urge nbfcs monitor risks business models balance sheets initiate necessary action required • nbfcs large net borrowers funds financial system highest ex posure banks several nbfcs maintain borrowing relationships multiple banks banks also subscribe debentures commercial papers concentrated linkages coupled high leverage may create contagion risks financial system concentration funding sources nbfcs also prudent strategy may face sudden drying funding stress events therefore may prudent nbfcs focus broad basing funding sources reduce dependenc e bank credit • pursuance high growth seems tendency among nbfcs get customers board oversimplified underwriting processes ease convenience borrower important come cost underwriting standards besides improving ease lending nbfcs equally focus maintaining quality loan portfolio • late business practices nbfc pps appear line regulatory guidelines large proportion lenders nbfc pps individuals expected well equipped understand risks involved providing credit instead educating lenders inherent risks lending activity nbfc pps observed underplay risks various means promising high assured returns structuring transactions providing anytime f und recall facilities etc let make absolutely clear breach licensing conditions regulatory guidelines non acceptable • revised framework microfinance loans rule based prescriptions pricing loans replaced principle based framework enhanced disclosures transparency requirements observed lenders quick pass increased costs borrowers reluctant pass benefits envisaged new framework mfis increased margins disproportionately new regime oblivious misuse freedom provided microfinance sector irresponsible practices would compel us act • post march banking sector turmoil us europe business models financial entities come enhanced scrutiny also observed concentrated business model nbfcs example nbfcs concentrated exposure segments consumer loans vehicle loans etc segment faces economic stress significant impact financial nbfcs turn lenders including banks self interest entities consider risks expect boards pulse issues • lastly view increasing reliance nbfcs delivering services digital medium partnerships fintechs sector’s exposure towards technology related risks including cybersecurity threats operational disruptions well reliance third party partnerships increased significantly therefore expect entities put place suitable risk mitigation measures commensurate business risk profile even means going beyond regulatory minimum requirements concluding thoughts recently come draft omnibus framework self regulatory organisations ros sro expected play important role improving compliance culture well promote ethical business practices customer protection better governance standards sound risk management measures contribute positively orderly development financial sector including nbfcs nbfc sector important stakeholder ndian f inancial sector strengthened regulation enhanced oversight nbfc sector best testimony importance nbfcs financial system overall economy it’s time nbfc sector comes shadow well banking sector sure nbfc play significant role achieving dream trillion economy going forward thank
