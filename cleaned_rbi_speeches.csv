good day welcome sixth bi monthly monetary policy governor’s teleconference researchers analyst reminder participant lines listen mode opportunity ask questions presentation concludes need assistance conference call please signal operator pressing ‘’ ‘’ touchtone phone please note conference recorded thank connected call dr raghuram g rajan opening statement happy take questions alpana killawala okay received questions already gautam singh spark capital governor mentioned inflation estimate march based assumption crude oil prices current level impact th pay commission also factored apart high possibility increase service tax rate budget would result higher service inflation considering factors inflation estimate march seem blue sk scenario actual inflation figure much higher around march scenario would rbi react dr raghuram g rajan taken pay commission estimates account know gov ernment going take board implement broadly speaking overall effects inflation extent government sta ys fiscal consolidation path pressure inflation offset cuts government make incorporate pay commission key issue effects rental housing inflation impact hra recommendations pay commi ssion accepted clearly adjustment take place take account extent extent take account figure see actual recommendations analysis meantime know ‘blue sky’ usually means completely dreaming think fair characterization around estimate takes lot factors account every factor mention offsetting factors key taken pay commission recommendations account dr patel would like add anything dr urjit r patel thank sir think couple issues – one many changes whatever mechanical cosmetic implications index respect pay commission especially relation hra something would ideal conditions look secondary tertiary effects monetary policy take care think like would shock one time going long lasting implication inflation would looking secondly low inflation take hold persisting hope continues point inflationary expectations also come hopefully help wage salary settlements go forward particularly important services side cpi rahul sangle exide life insurance sir bond market witnessing transmission policy rate cuts done till see year government security yields less level last year plan take measures regard dr raghuram g rajan target longterm yield see consequence necessary actions take elsewhere clearly focused staying within inflation targets one hope bring yields medium term second extent liquidity needs market supply liquidity needs course also extent look availability buyers one things government looking facilitate greater entry pension funds insurance companies markets see longterm yield consequence variety factors don’t directly intervene manage perhaps unlike central banks khan sahib would like add something shri hr khan say reacted correct statement cannot take one single point say reacted take example two year horizon st january repo rate year take whole year new year fact basis point reacted take period time sometimes factor expected cuts sometimes don’t factor wil l cuts plus governor mentioned morning statement also variety factors including supply issues outlook issues expectation issues particularly state government loans ballooned like anything last year aroun lakh year around lakh supply increased factored variety factors governor mentioned contributes true say said earlier reacted take slightly longer period see reacted prasanna icici securities radhika r barclays rbi consider crr omos one tools longterm liquidity management rbi view current crr level optima l dr raghuram g rajan first yes possible inputs liquidity management said morning variety instruments manage short term liquidity well longterm liquidity omos one far optimal l evel crr goes think strong reason right move away level also looking entire liquidity frame work next months review keep apprised developments jayesh ku mar kotak securities cpi forecast assumed crude oil remain current level convenience forecast dr raghuram g rajan michael would like take dr michael patra know every forecast set certain initial conditions assumption initial conditions takes account recent developments spot future market also consistent forecast made agencies like imf international energy agency promit sengupta aiwmi given lag wage transformation time latest norms disclosure stressed assets increased banks ’ cost since recent result two india’s big banks show sorry state affairs think going forward entire banking system absorb se systemic risk dr raghuram g rajan okay long question first think would mischa racterization say sorry state affairs yes stressed assets need get banks continue action taking put back track broadly speaking process well underway attempt make sure across board end process banks wit h relatively well understood transparent balance sheet adequately provisioned think getting think enough capital system various scenario suggest would enough variety eventualities capital absorb potential losses happen think system poised fund future growth end exercise think one alarmist process well hand clearly involves short term subtractions profit loss account banks provision said repeatedly assets come back track provisions come back profitability best take precautionary measures hopefully growth picks economy picks world economy stress ed sectors improve making sure dependent hope improvement fact positioned variety alternative firmly believe system postpone process line may get much bigger harder handle government rbi together moving along banks sanj ana dadawala ubs securities recently referred imf estimates india’s consolidated fiscal deficit figures central government room given oil etc states clearly would look pay commission implementation states leading effective cons olidated fiscal expansion india terms impact macro parameters dr raghuram g rajan let ask dr patel answer dr urjit r patel aware central government actually built provision th pay commission impact per medium term expenditure framework february additional expenditure due th pay commission projected crores states need emulate c enter build buffers prior implement ing th pay commission recommendations would good housekeeping amit agrawal societe generale think ecb loans hedging last data point given th august meeting talked ecb hedging q think foreign loan repayment problems manageable inr depreciating dr raghuram g rajan let ask mr khan address shri h r khan actually trying fine tune data collection system things stand nine months april december less figure around intention hedge trying prescribing hedge ratio corporates regulatory side trying sensitize risks involved unhedge exposure provisioning capital charge norms trying get capturing data one side side recent changes w e announced th november focus rupee denominated ecbs exchange risk lender example infrastructure dollar balance sheet moved rupee side help mitigate external loan related exposure third point ecb recent past robust compare last year year ecb lower may around million million think serious problem account prudential measure place trying move people rupee denominated dr raghuram g rajan also two reasons may understating ext ent hedges first include entities natural hedges essentially price dollars second ecb borrowing dollars course bulk remember rupee depreciating dollar actually strengthened currenc ies careful saying immediately exchange rate depreciation fact real effective terms really moved year manish banthia icici prudential amc though talk real gdp nominal gdp much lower trend take five year government bonds proxy riskfree rate nominal interest rates higher nominal growth income levels go interest cost affects debt payment capabilit ies rbi’s view dr urjit r patel well currently five year government bond yield ministry finance’s mid year review nominal gdp growth projected therefore nominal income growth higher tha n interest cost even example rajesh agr awal bank f america going back september policy first external developments august important factor rbi cutting reported bps similar risk development january second also highlighted expected one year bill would roughly higher one year expect ed inflation one year bill yield fall ha trading forecasted inflation end excluding pay commission impact two factors relevant today deciding rates dr raghuram g rajan always pick couple factors say policy driven look whole range factors policy determined agglomeration factors would fixate one two say driving policy else would replace us machine give rule said think point made today wai ting see whether projections inflation develop whether incoming information inflation remembe r last readings want see new readings pl ay sense come want get certainty also next month get lot events happening important budget well implementation pay commission recommendation allow us better sense path future inflation certainly wait watch mode badri nivas chakravarty citibank last para policy mentioned “ structural reforms budget create space monetary policy support growth” open possibility inter meeting cut would say emergency situation intermeeti ng dr raghuram g rajan think policy advertise deny inter meeting cuts necessary undertake think central bank ever binds hands said past w ill reiterate typically inter meeting cuts happen time great sense urgency sometimes signal broad change direction policy really employed last time nd think centre stage point see rationales strong want either say going deny possibility namrata mittal sbi mutual fund looking weighted average call money rate well anchored repo rate measures money market rate like c p cd rates moving high higher rates market instruments impede transmission indicative liquid ity shortage economy view dr ur jit r patel times easing cycle cp cd rates actually also moved central bank operational daily level look policy repo rate call weighted average call market rates moving together difference two actually come fiscal year cp cd rate movements could also reflecting things transmission repo rate call money rate conse quently beyond dr raghuram g rajan think engaged certainly trying look liquidity conditions liquidity framework factors looked general point sense rket certainly demand liquidity also supplying plenty demand proof pudding precisely weighted average call rate hugging policy rate vishal goel ubs securities question stressed loans scope asset quality review rbi rbi go weak corporates banks select corporates dr raghuram g rajan let ask mr mundra answer question shri ss mundra see scope sense conduct asset quality review banks every year difference process time come rather spacing year pooled within certain period otherwise followed process past year together given advantage accounts rather looking isolation could looked totality across banking system observations discussed banks shared banks encouraged proactively conservatively look accounts classify appropriately need prepare future possibility weakness arising way enhanced provisioning vishal goel basically assume rbi already highlighted like almost cases would thought stressed think like would list come rbi shri ss mundra think appreciate one thing portfolio static entity one give point time look portfolio always development either take account identified earlier positive movement happened looking economy around developments may inclusion say point time reasonable assurance larger part portfolios looked dr raghuram g rajan couple additions one course banks look entire portfolio time plus look entire portfolio perhaps degree scrutiny annual financial inspections think answer broadly yes mr mundra said bulk problem looked us detail also broadly looked us banks contin ue looking second even course process height ened awareness proactive behavior banks loans actually turned around loans put back track promoters selling ass ets brining money etc f course reverse also happen loans normal may go track something dynamic situation watch see broadly yes anurag mantr jefferies firstly assume asset classification accounts identified review uniform across banks end fy end two quarters shri ss mundra exactly mean uniform anur ag mantr sir example certain banks spoken second degree effects asset quality review terms may bank classifying n account npa another probably asking end accou nts identified potentially stressed asset classification across banks currently diverging shri ss mundra think explanation asked also contained previous reply let clarify asset classification continue governed rule based system vogue point time within quite possible account npa one bank may npa another bank viewed record recovery perspective essentially two outcome governor mentioned identification come bank per rule classified npa trigger two things one may corrective action part promoters well banks may need account slipping npa category banks existing bank also upgrade period time outcome could wh en account npa bank may gives indication banks become sensitive weakness account start preparing weakness manifest way provisioning whole e xercise moved direction going forward mentioned either account come back upgraded category f provisioning started prepares banks better deal account really falls npa category anurag mantr secondly could help us understand would typical haircut would assumed various stressed sectors like say iron steel metals infra etc various scenario would worked dr raghuram g rajan typically stress particular loan depends period deterioration taken place longer period deterioration bigger haircut sense don’t think uniform number give account toaccount basis broadly soon entity starts getting period say cash flow stress period onwards account ages extent provisioning required goes anurag mantr could give us take takeover discom bonds states extra bonds issued discoms would bagged states terms asset classification provisioning dr raghuram g rajan state replace bank’s loan bonds equal value state asset classification performing since states paying performing loan investment essentially anurag mantr even though bonds would issued discoms eventually bagged states issued states directly dr raghuram g rajan think still discussing plays bonds issued state banks lieu loans banks made discoms absolutely question asset quality dhaval gada motilal oswal securities firstly rbi asset quality review cover stressed exposures banks overseas operations well also exposures stressed group taken credit substitutes second question clarity balance sheet cleanup march mean going towards direction banks recognize potential stressed asset npa increase coverage exposures march could see increase provisioning even subsequent years dr raghuram g rajan second question intent broadly get problem aken care time shri mundra said continuing loans coming back standard classification loans going hope time bulk exercise finished positives match negatives sense balance sheet stabilized moreover balance sheet transparent know problems largely taken care shri ss mundra add considering first part question overseas exposure mentioned whole exercise intended overall review encourage banks proactively deal problem know large part overseas exposure banking community respect entity exposure sitting india n book kind review done banks take proactive measure think quite logical would looking – exposure sitting books india well exposure sitting overseas books dhaval gada sir would possible give broad sense would level provisioning quantum stress ed loan could materialize whole exercise dr raghuram g rajan moving target said mapped different scenarios think important banks basically follow process think good indicator probably results declaring clean don’t want pre judge process giving numbers done basically looked variety possible numbers various scenarios assured system enough capital absorb numbers well truly feasible possibility mahrukh adajani ya idfc question also pertains asset quality basically review asset quality review seen bank results seen similar size banks reporting divergent asset quality go data available whether mca data sector wise disclosures banks feel right divergence would review review dr raghuram g rajan know going actually constant communication banks prepare declare results certainly consult us intent essentially making sure level playing field disclosures see sense mr mundra said banks record recovery technical phrase implying history payments loan loan may performing one bank may nonperforming another bank simply borrower keeping one bank’s payments time asset classification differences tend equalize reason may certain bank classified particular loan classified elsewhere extent may variation broadly announcements banks reflect sense need see bank announcing relatively low provisioning time probably means need shri ss mundra would say similar size banks mean similar kinds portfolios banks may similar size portfolios may vastly different even accounts sitting portfolio banks quite possible loan size different think things would ultimately reflect level provisioning charge pl respective banks make hemendra bhatia vadilal forex look indian rupee last one month almost appreciated chinese yuan policy rbi actually allow rupee depreciate us dollar counter yuan depreciation dr raghuram g rajan repeat “ mantra ” actually follow intervene case excessive volatility try maintain level rate depreciation currencies done continue don’t look part icular currencies say moved lot intervene basis srinivas v deutsche bank given nominal growth challenge economy faces right given backdrop really imposition inflation targeting framework really necessary balance given nominal growth challenge case actually change functioning interest rate corridor current width basis points calibrate lower may basis points recalibration targeted liquidity deficit keeping sanctity inflation targeting framework dr raghuram g rajan missing link nominal g dp “difficulty ” corridor f irst would say seems cpi still services accounting value added assuming deflationary structure economy point perhaps little stretched denying fact overall gdp deflators depending calculate come hard see significant negative given size services economy well extent agriculture sector yes anufacturing experiencing period deflation largely result lower input cost much traditional reasons think nominal gdp problem extent perhaps overstated point let us see progresses fact actual problem see inflation coming substantially give monetary policy sufficient room act broader issue size corridor amongst issues explore take verall look framework srinivas v clarify link really meant clear really transmission perspective given shock degrees freedom provided changing width corridor dr raghuram g rajan biggest contribution transmission probably change marginal cost pricing april st would direct contribution credit course may mind transmission bond markets said take overall view see additional concerns broadly speaking point think reasonable job providing liquidity mangesh kulkarni almondz global securities wanted know progress gyan sangam meeting held last year next gyan sangam meeting expected shri ss mundra would appreciate gyan sangam exercise rbi’s presence observer get detailed elaborate answer question needs direct ed elsewhere second part question understand next gyan sangam proposed held first week march brinda jagirdar independent economist given books banks still concern government moved small saving rate bond market rates also softened conducive conditions transmission monetary policy rate dr raghuram g rajan good question guess tried answer different ways give phrase ‘small saving rates’ clearly looking government linking bond market rates allow flexible time give investors put money small saving instruments n adequate return ties market returns help transmission broader issue transmission shri khan said bond markets time think credit markets also clearly looking sense come april st change marginal cost pricing well time banks compete lend think see greater transmission take place optimistic matter time rather significant impediments process alpana killawala optimistic note shall close dr raghuram g rajan thank alpana killawala thank sir thank e veryone joining moderator thank much ladies gentlemen conclude conference call thank joining us may

largely focus rbi’s efforts foster innovation financial ecosystem emerging technologies artificial intelligence likely reshape financial landscape banks played extremely important role supporting growth story indian economy analyse evolution indian banking sector last decades classify evolution three distinct phases – post nationalisation liberalisation third current phase could term democratisation level financial intermediation time independence quite low india – ranging per cent gdp less case next two decades limited financialisation outreach banking services scope mobilise deposits facilitate credit flow support aspirations developing nation constrained trend changed nationalisation banks ensured wider banking reach led opening bank branches across country resulting greater mobilisation deposits growth credit primarily catering credit needs priority sectors inputs provided chandan kumar pradeep kumar saurabh pratap singh gratefully acknowledged figure historical

ed bond think around outstanding could follow subsequent issuances inflation trajectory gone different direction deep discounts discussion government revised version inflation index ed bond institutional investor well retail investor let us see new thing comes possibly could consider take care illiquid inflation index ed bond whether switching take view kumar rachapudi anz bank two questions one liquidity conditions mentioned view quite flush look indicators like either reserve money even incremental credit deposit ratio right th e last months versus ldr ratio overall banks obviously daily basis notwithstanding fact deposit ing money term reverse repos rbi still net borrowers central bank wondering thinking liquidity conditions accommodative second question sterilization f x inflows rbi probably look f x month implied yields around much higher overnight rate think way sterilizing prohibiting corporate hedging f x liabilities considering ways sterilization dr raghuram g rajan first question think looking overly march numbers liquidity generally tight look forward see happens liquidity unwinds forward looking perspective saying plenty l iquidity market second question far forward premium goes intervene take account various issues including size premia etc deciding might effective way intervene said f act premia sometimes push variety reasons intervention example credit tight arbitrage leg create synthetic forward may difficult may therefore imply higher premium otherwise wo uld treat expansion premium primarily rbi intervention could variety reasons kumar rachapudi sir following question liquidity assessment see banks borrowing le us say may june april presuming increased government spending borrowing slightly lower numbers march according projections numbers may june dr michael patra lot contingent factors economy let us say economy goes turning point moves obviously little excess demand liquidity let us say less agricultur al activity mons oon turn favourable see completely different roll liquidity may june early forecast liquidity june many imponderables exist today imran ayed aegon religare question probably partly answered related inflation index ed bonds good looking forward issuing cpi linked inflation index ed bonds start visibility last time around bonds issued people created products around inflation index ed bonds bonds longer issued issue cpi linked bonds could give us roadmap certainty issued future develop certain products certain business case around inflation index ed bonds provide customers real hedge inflation also business case us dr raghuram g rajan good suggestion certainly k eep mind aastha g udwani birla sun life asset management sir one question three conditions spirit actually four laid one condition accommodative monetary policy stance going forward point conditions take least may longer months terms shaping impact decipher next policy rate move actually deferred time four conditions met dr raghuram g rajan sure say conditions met seems mind numerical something clear yes condition think conditions reflecting kinds things would like see movement precisely much something look compositely looking happening including information comes would ascribe threshold number conditions say falls x action forthcoming composite big picture going look put elements play longer time announcements made likely happen also give us sense composite picture aastha g udwani sir would allow one point talking example impact transmissions front loaded rate cuts supply response inputs power land announcements intention things happen rbi going look next action dr raghuram g rajan trying get precise saying look elements develop composite sense obviously transmission take place much likely sort prospects happening things wil l gauge determining make next move want precise saying elements need look anjali verma phillip capital two questions one talk real interest rates looking repo interest rate looking deposit rate second question although understand rbi largely targeting focused achieving cpi targets right completely ignoring wpi isinflation underway dr raghuram g rajan far real interest rate goes thus far talking risk free real interest rate indian context typically would mean look forward cpi something like repo rate minus look forward cpi would good definition working definition think real interest rate far wpi goes clearly issue number look form going international forces effect wpi well corporate pressures often number indicates extent corporate pricing power corporate input cost gives us sense corporate see inflation different say citizen element thinking target cpi wpi naveen sharma hdfc life two questions one fiscal consolidation path saying government deleveraging path going fiscal consolidation path private sector see idprivate also deleveraging path banks able lend big ticket size ca pital cons trained talking psu banks constitute total book fii limits opened whatever corporate bond fii limits precisely money going pfcs one question whe n economy picks going fund growth dr raghuram g rajan good question economy picks alert funding constraints see starkly see certainly alert think government also alert perhaps capital needs psu banks let us see room banks bring especially psus access markets raise capital markets also government psus market access make case need capital sure point capital forthcoming government position right mean thinking active discussion going government things naveen sharma sir one question wpi cpi ha answered stark difference fuel inflation wpi cpi core reason used close last three four readings rbi looking think difficult get composition cpi right way data collected obviously series old rbi looking also headline number core number go ing dr michael patra petrol eum import reflected wpi reflected cpi fuel households consume fuel category find really firewood electricity prices determining evolution fuel category motor fuels households use transport communication cpi difference wpi cpi watch closely srinivas deutsche bank sir one square forecast inflation growth end year backdrop flexible inflation targeting really look one applies basically monetary policy rule forecast inflation growth one square stance guidance given dr raghuram g rajan basically think hint ing measure potential growth plug figure going tell whether consistent stance right think wh michael talked earlier course admit still trying understand new cso numbers somewhat constrained project growth based new numbers understand well thought understood old numbers may se em michael said determining potential growth easy short series data creates little bit noise feel fairly comfortable stance given think us old growth numbers mind new growth numbers mind feel extent still slightly potential srinivas currently investment cycle really picking system banks borrowers undergoing time correcti time correction really mean banks faced stressed assets need maintain capital borrowers need delever given backdrop would made sense cut crr giving number say basis points would actually helped transmission liquidity perspective really cost funds perspective banks could actually compressed time correction ways actually tantamount backdoor recapitalization banking system could complemented rs crore budgeted could actually helped transmission line enquiry correct r thoughts dr urjit r patel think comparing apples bananas issue crr discussed morning basis points reduction crr would resulted basis points reduction lending rate think issue banks enough projects coming corporate leveraged ways issue tackled government’s increase investment announced budget investment gap ways filled cycle kick started respect roads railways power sector dr raghuram g rajan first think endorsing urjit’s point crr cuts miniscule basis points cut crr would release rs crore permanently system result barely basis points cut lending rates even pass clear also outset think talkin g orders magnitude difference crr understand market got enthused n fact irrelevance point far lending rates go think issue credit talking think sbi chairman today talked little bit credit growth picking view coal telecom obviously need credit auctions conducted good sign also look cmi e data came yesterday looks like investment starting pick early signs go town celebrating stalled projects coming investment intentions picking think starting see beginnings f investment cycle finally hope create enough new avenues purchasing assets liquefying highly leveraged players deleverage sell bring equity leverage comes way let us see abhay axis bank wanted ask reducing fixed rate overnight liquidity injection earlier also mean reducing overnight laf allow us dr raghuram g rajan think reduction overnight laf currently contemplated stay ndtl want keep readily accessible window fixed rate everything else moved market rate th e intention us providing additional liquidity need ensure rate close policy rate market rate close policy rate harish agarwal firstrand bank question regarding reverse repo since like operating reverse repo rate understand wpi around looking cpi comfortably sitting cpi may come going forward looking operate reverse repo going forward given point time dr raghuram g rajan hope mind saying second issue found little puzzling time around first crr people got sort gung ho second movement reverse repo move reverse repo today means operational rate market would move talking basis points cut policy rate smell coffee gu ys going cut interest rate basis points overnight policy rate today repo rate want bring rate cut policy rate given conditions cut p olicy rate whole suggestion moving reverse repo moving liquidity surplus pardon expression nuts samiran chakraborty standard chartered bank two questions related one monetary policy report projection cpi inflation august somewhat higher midpoint around policy statement sa id closer wondering whether subjective element induced model talk target august second built forecast cpi august number surprise affect monetary policy decision dr michael patra projection august really comes already know know today base effects right august allow cpi inflation ease projection show wonder separ ate projection show come market participants seem suggest favo urable base effects take rise samiran chakraborty looking projection cpi inflation monetary policy report midpoint show august dr michael patra yes think need look carefully also policy extension policy shubhada rao yes bank wanting seek comments disconnect banks rbi perception comfortable liquidity clearly seems hampering transmission assessment believe seems disconnect comfortable liquidity banking system ’s perspective rbi’s perspective dr raghuram g rajan may well right disconnect perception let say think rbi’s perception comfortable liquidity done away windows could borrow amount liquidity fixed price result certain market players used finance windows findin g harder go raise money markets tried keep market rate close policy rate injecting sufficient amounts liquidity occasionally spikes example march st look volatility around policy rate substantially lower course would zero give unlimited ability borrow policy rate would go window borrow much wanted given want stop move towards market borrowing players think achieved fair amount consolidation narrowness movement market rates tend hug policy rate would say plenty liquidity market least short term liquidity hug policy rate also aspect long term liquidity much increase size balance sheet accommodate credit growth make n estimate nominal growth economy translates expansion size balance sheet year try maintain size growth balance sheet years determined primarily purchase government bonds years determined primarily purchase foreign exchange purchase substantial amounts foreign exchange beyond want grow balance sheet sort adj ust size balance sheet selling government bonds words sterilization basically think successful aspects clearly people talk may think differently shubhada rao would certain sense visibility liquidity going forward medium long term short liquidity maybe banking system whole would feel confident lowering rates dr raghuram g rajan ultimately banks ake call primary source borrowing c annot primary source borrowing windows cannot primary source financial system finances murmurs banks somebod puts money o’clock night cannot immediately turn around deposit adequate rate question management extended windows banks able redeploy money quite bit accommodate requests ultimately central bank cannot way banks manage liquidity find ways including sometimes taking clients ’ money giving appropriate interest rate comes o’clock night short term liquidity management sometimes source friction banks figure appropriate amount liquidity going offer clients always amount liquidity perfectly well manage balance sheets today think going persuade reduce lending rates offering liquidity amounts possibly mean going able offer ndtl ny circumstance windows past brought see

2024-02-08 Shaktikanta Das,edited transcript governor’s interview cnbc tv may cnbc tv central bankers centre action saviours economy ravages covid rapidly rollback inflation reserve bank india also first line defence country made position clear may th unexpected cycle rise rates inflation nevertheless per cent man hot seat rbi governor us governor thank much indeed sparing time us shaktikanta das thank cnbc tv looks like really coordinated synchronised action centre rbi may th policy saw bunch fuel prices fuel excise duty cuts sense inflation think get coveted per cent shaktikanta das first thing mentioned coordinated action must mention way see entered another phase coordinated action fiscal monetary authorities check inflation rbi taken number steps last two three months fact would say much earlier taking steps somehow certain sections market missed explain government taken action wheat intermediaries various kinds intermediaries raw materials course big one petrol diesel put together definitely sobering impact inflation going forward petrol diesel tax reductions announced week end rbi back drawing table fact drawing board almost every day rework numbers give numbers next mpc first week june cnbc tv reason im asking poll cnbc deviating poll economists dont see per cent mark coming till fourth quarter january march quarter looks like three quarters cpi per cent shaktikanta das october till quite distance away lets speculate point time could actions also intervening period today may five months left let us see plays cannot give number today working next mpc june right moment say inflation projection mind last year large professional forecasters number moves tandem rbi numbers som etimes lower sometimes higher cnbc tv distinctly higher sir last number per cent pre fuel cut average street per cent shaktikanta das ill tell last year rather year february gave per cent many people thought optimistic ask explain optimistic professional forecasters per cent subsequently moved per cent think professional forecasters around around maybe little per cent moving tandem rbi number give june without working numbers run mpc correct part give number cnbc tv let come interest rates rate hikes made speech monetary policy statement may read dr patra’s minutes seem give impression want come ie pre covid level quickly understood right want come say august shaktikanta das broadly right extent rbi would like raise rates next meetings next meeting least said minutes one reasons cycle meeting may want much stronger action june highly avoidable cannot cutting rates basis points basis points somet hing like numbers mentioning random numbers please dont misinterpret numbers cnbc tv said pre covid thats shaktikanta das precovid said larger context liquidity well interest rates read minutes carefully say pre covid talking growth terms pre covid levels talking liquidity terms pre covid levels also talking rates terms pre covid levels expectation rate hike brainer increase repo rates much able tell say may accurate cnbc tv patra’s statement said even reached neutral accommodation go pre covid level thats market clutching shaktikanta das lot discussions deliberations take place mpc come conclusion cnbc tv let come liquidity part mentioned want come back pre covid levels pre covid liquidity level say february january two half lakh crores surplus liquidity currency finance report says two half lakh crore liquidity inflation starts rising also something want get quickly two half lakh crore shaktikanta das explain said normalise liquidity conditions multi year time cycle press conference said multiyear could two years could three years extent going sort bringing liquidity depend evolving growth inflation dynamics part strategy second thing requirement liquidity adequacy liquidity different adequacy liquidity current year economy also growing business activities rebounding therefore moving figure position liquidity would like normalise liquidity remove overhang liquidity system move situation adequate credit available system meet prod uctive requirements economy support credit offtake credit offtake takes place part liquidity also gets absorbed therefore target eliminate overhang liquidity time period two three years time ensure adequate liquidity system cnbc tv overhang would probably one trillion rupees balance zero liquidity two half trillion rupees current currency finance report said could incre ase inflation thats wanted know greater hurry reach also hike crr well selling albeit small quantities nds government bonds liquidity draining steps therefore asking whether initial steps little faster shaktikanta das cant say intermittent intervention nds om market really liquidity sucking emanating many complex developments taking place market time time intervene various complexity factors liquidity withdrawal remember one earlier interventions said learning past experience want avoid li quidity trap dont want get chakravyooh situation without knowing exit route liquidity infusion tltro whatever sunset date example announced total liquidity support lakh cror es actual offtake lakh crores five lakh crores already returned rest seven lakh crore still continues system overnight sdf get back two lakh crore rest vrrr particular box therefore bring calibrated phased manner cnbc tv let come rates one minutes think ashima goyal said market’s pricing rate hikes excessive swap market pricing something like peak repo rates would see excessive shaktikanta das wont like comment swap markets momentum factors fact would expect swap markets overall market guided reserve banks statements actions let mention think las two years especially extremely stressful times covid pandemic sort compact rbi financial markets convergence thoughts many aspects able reach today recovery economic activity become steady gaining traction cnbc tv nevertheless inflation issue probably likelihood three quarters going per cent per cent market would want know looking rates one members monetary policy council speak need get positive real rates least zero real rates deeply negative per cent inflation running well seven deeply negative also think need return positive least zero real rates shaktikanta das inflation major area concern today major area interest everybody country let explain take little time perhaps normal two facts would like mention beginning number one interest rates almost every country today negative except perhaps russia brazil interest rates take advanced economy take negative territory second thing regard inflation target advanced economies example per cent usa per cent united kingdom per cent euro area per cent think except japan one country excess per cent india target per cent tolerance band goes per cent per cent analysts market say reached peak dont like comment depend many factors including action central bank taking government taking allow little time think perhaps pre empt many questions look inflation mandate target given rbi reserve bank india act dual target says maintain price stability keeping mind objective growth price stability per cent plus minus per cent either side keeping mind objective growth experienced deepest contraction economy first quarter covid set minus per cent economy year minus per cent years final number come st sense economy revived exceeded howsoever moderately exceeded pre pandemic level exceeded levels private consumption become entered positive territory private inves tment also showing signs improvement therefore primary target time focus growth bring back inflation sort tolerate inflation per cent intermittently period inflation spiked per cent one two occasions even touched per cent last year looking numbers inflation almost came per cent multiple occasions remember correctly january happened around april perhaps september october came per cent stopped calling due transitory factors supply side factors remain even dominant current inflation stopped calling transitory concluded going transitory entered calendar year fact question asked thought ill take opportunity clarify wider understanding questions asked referred earlier february mpc projection inflation stay optimistic ill tell per cent momentum inflation month month october onwards moderating food price inflation moderating appeared upply chain bottlenecks start easing easing covid supply side factors ease even february done stress tests done scenario analysis found even margin error basis points per cent assumed crude oil prices little gave us inflation around per cent fairly comfortable roadmap future inflation moderate war started february february everything changed april mpc took several decisive actions changed sequence priorities put inflation first growth next normalised laf corridor changed stance saying focusing withdrawal accommodation rate action rate action introduced sdf per cent reverse repo sdf per cent ie increase basis points basis points increase liquidity absorption rate resulted overnight call rates immediately going basis points rate action market everyone take note rate action month april think many people seem lost question sudden meeting sudden april rate action basis points overnight rates went basis points mpc print several new devel opments took place example fao world bank came food price index became clear food price inflation stay important statement mpc statement minutes comes days statement read said situation fast changing dynamic actions tailored accordingly think many read right dont know may announced cycle eting forgot particular bit statement stop cnbc tv well youve defended told whether want come positive real rates anytime soon shaktikanta das move towards soon depend evolving situation correct part fact possible also forecast soon situation dynamic example inflation metrics undergo change action timely action government cnbc tv governor spoke actions central government also taken actions going impact fiscal deficit possibly also current account deficit rise fiscal deficit possibly market borrowing think borrow looks like tax revenues given away extent three trillion rupees shaktikanta das cannot speak obviously behalf government worked finance ministry sufficiently long period time let say one one correlation increase government expenditure one head need additional borrowing al l figures keep moving throughout year move year please remember month may second month current financial year certain heads expenditure requirements go certain heads expenditure requirements absorption capacity go revenue also thing happen revenue show greater buoyancy fact revenue figures currently going recent experience gst direct taxes look robust sense government remains committed cannot really speak behalf government sense government maintain fiscal deficit target given budget able answer sense several discussions continuous process reserve bank governments say government would sort committed maintaining fiscal deficit cnbc tv even yields gone year chances government program picks credit offtake picks go even towards per cent mark done one crr hike selling dollars bonds think scope help government open market purchases shaktikanta das rbi debt manager government rbi use instruments disposal sort ensure orderly evolution yield curve something said earlier october think said management yield curve public good market central bank important role mentioned earlier kind compact entered world yields gone due complexity factors im going detail everywhere yields gone us yields less per cent today almost touching per cent exceeded per cent per cent everywhere yields gone naturally country also yields gone rbi use various policy instruments cnbc tv including omos shaktikanta das able say various policy instruments operation twist currency swap another liquidity management tool introduced three years ago remember several tools using w e evaluate situation second month current year watchful informal compact market think continue communicate market constantly rbi remains committed ensuring non disruptive completion government borrowing program ensuring orderly evolution yield curve cnbc tv worry sir shaktikanta das use various instruments time time depending requirement cnbc tv market interested omos instrument thats predominantly market moving shaktikanta das dont want bound said omos instruments table decide instrument used cnbc tv overall worry twin deficits deteriorating quite possible deficit beyond smidge maybe saved nominal gdp likely high high inflation nevertheless fiscal deficit improving likewise current account deficit likely per cent actually discouraging exports items like steel worry macros worsening shaktikanta das think exports would strong fiscal deficit said sense government maintain fiscal deficit current account deficit domain let say current account deficit able manage v ery comfortably year indias external sector remains strong exports think th successive month us billion latest number billion export sector continues strong imports also picked incidentally increased imports reflective strength underlying fundamentals economy sense demand pick even higher prices import still sustaining means domestic demand reviving hope made point clear domestic demand reviving imports going despite high prices revival domestic demand thats positive trend pmi numbers services manufacturing expansion territory fact april numbers previous number monsoon already hit andaman islands think anytime soon hit indian coasts kerala slowly move monsoon looking good agriculture looking good food stocks much discussion think rice stocks four times buffer wheat stocks remember correctly times buffer level therefore india comfortably placed deal domestic fundamentals economy good external sector remains strong fdi inflows steady despite moderation think recent months given kind underlying fundamentals fact external sector strong total external debt per cent don’t see big jump current account deficit whatever number come know end year comfortably placed finance current account deficit cnbc tv hit us billion trade deficit every month since september long time looks like us billion given trade deficit per month billion dollars year

moderates assumption moderation take place extent moderation need ascertain dr subir gokarn second question important indicated opening remarks fact signs moderation much evidence discussions stakeholders lead dilemma whether go stronger hike versus lower one think really worked favour stronger hike essentially robustness several components demand fact low interestsensitivity example consumption indications quite buoyant course ar e components interestsensitive seem showing signs moderation otherwise great signs secondly even ongoing fiscal consolidation process still significant contribution dema nd coming public expenditure know result crisis response substantially higher today crisis seen steady improvement fisc al situation hose two components essentially quite robust fiscal situation adjusting still quite strong given felt downside risk growth interest rate hikes would fairly bounded whereas upside risks inflation pa rticularly perception number action seen adequa te course people l expected mean everybody thought right thing predicting action making judgment opt imal thought stronger action essentially consistent new stance signalled may course downside risk growth pointed document indicated range think grow th may go end day also think strong lower bound risk whereas inflation risk unfortunately upward bound unbounded many ways may play balance risks favour going little aggressively inflation shubhada rao thank moderator thank next question lin e srinivas varadarajan credit suisse singapore please go ahead srinivas varadarajan would like thank panel taking questions two que stions first one goes follows one looks inflation expectations survey publish every quarter numbers th e average oneyear forward inflation reserve bank india july page

forecast despite monetary po licy action basis points cycle also seems expectations real ly sensitive policy actions taken far kind point towa rds basically wage price spiral significant risk first question th e second question real rate india one takes sbi base rate quarter oneyear forward inflation expectations real rate still negative basis points would respond dr subir gokarn think first question put lo weight fact survey odd respondents inflation expectat ions surveyed cut across range socio economic categories relativel high weight high proportion people food largest single item household expenditure far true daily waged labourers selfemployed people formal sector kind relatively small proportion people whitecollar professionals could say recent experience food impact inflation expectations think playing significant role expectations moving certainly pay lot attention terms directionality wh ich point mentioned movement something important suggests people starting see inflation rising much terms actual number really weighted outcome sample composition think put caveats broader point expectations possibility translating wage demand think relevant read mmd towards end document introduced discussion wage dynamics significant obviously significant bargaining power many labour market segments translating heard anecdotally showing aggregate data well large wage increases ability index even implicit contracts informal market transactions quite high high expectations rising expectations certainly enhance risk spiral emerging recall one statements made macro money developments document need focus dealing wage price dynamics important issue dealing expectations even translate dire ctly household let us keep mind wage twosided contract whether worker asking wage employer reserve bank india july page willing give one similar expectations terms inflation able agree mutually acceptable inflation premium employers feeling pinch talking po ssibility moderation premium may forthcoming counterva iling force side even monetary policy showing indivi dual household expectations clearly impact potential employer wil ling pay given assessment business prospects transmission terms second question think fer back issue response previous question see much directly explicitly said clearly still significant role fiscal public spending playing demand terribly interestsensitive long continues adjustment ongoing ministry finan ce clearly laid year timeframe fiscal consolidation even ongoing still pl aying large role demand keeps pressure demand regardless monetary policy actions taken along consideratio ns feel demand quite robust good reasons example priv ate consumption spending also part reason decided stay take factors also taken

opportunity interest rate di fferential bring foreign inflow country wanted know one thing rise inflows one hand lead appreciation exchange rate first question rbi allow appreciation exchange rate secondly allow incr ease foreign exchange reserves move rbi allows increased appreciation exchange rate rbi think lead lowering imported inflation dr sabir gokarn first question polic position intervene forex market objective determining setting exchange rate extent intervene done lot time essentially react sharp volatility rate determination mind exchange rate essentially market determined within broad contours capital controls debt flows inflow result interest rate arbitrage seeing point large inflow default response would let currency appreciate let market determine exchange rate would case significant accumulation reserves rupee appreciate yes obviously everything else remaining positive impact inflation extent imports become cheaper also contractionary sense exports become less competitive aggreg ate demand goes helps contain demand therefore bring inflation really matter magnitude happened last several months th rate fairly variable capital inflows much larger current account deficit much change exchange rate overall hypothetical situation yes would help deal appreciation reality even relatively open capital account point rupee moves tw directions moving distinctly one direction manvinder singh sir second question rbi says huge demand aggregate demand aggregate supply huge liquidity present economy think instead moving basis points rise repo reverse repo rate would good something would done crr front repo reverse repo would raised basis points dr subir gokarn yeah interesting point think distinguish notion liquidity referring broa der sense sort large buoyant demand economy talk liquidity talking reserve bank india july page resources available financial system basis expand credit typically banks would need liquidity support crr cash reserve ratio
