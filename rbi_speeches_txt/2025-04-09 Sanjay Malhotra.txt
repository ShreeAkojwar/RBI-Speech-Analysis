Yogesh Dayal :
Welcome to the post -Monetary Policy press conference.  Today , we have Governor
Shri Shaktikanta Das , Deputy Governor s – Shri M. K. Jain, Dr. Michael D. Patra, Shri
M. Rajeshwar Rao, Sh ri T. Rabi Sankar  and we have Executive Directors  Dr. O.  P.
Mall and Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, along with my colleague,  Muneesh Kapoor.  I welco me all
of you to  this press conference and without much ado let me begin by inviting the
Governor  to make opening remarks and then we will go ahead by taking your
questions one by one.
Shaktikanta Das:
Thank you Yogesh. By way of opening remarks, I have six points to make:
i) The first point is that t he rate in this meeting of the MPC is obviously a pause.
Future action will depend on the evolving situation.
ii) Secondly, the headline inflation has eased and so also all its components. But
there is no room for complacency. The MPC remains resolutely focused on the
4% inflation target in the interest of sustainable growth.
iii) Thirdly, t he Indian economy presents a story of resilience with macroeconomic
and financi al stability. Prospects for growth are steadily improving and
becoming broad- based.
iv) Fourthly, the healthy twin balance sheets of banks and corporates also augur
well for GDP growth.
v) Fifthly, the external sector is eminently viable, as reflected in the curr ent
account deficit situation, s tability of the Indian rupee and build- up of foreign
exchange reserves.
vi) Finally, the Reserve Bank’s liquidity management will be nimble and two- sided
as per requirement and as demonstrated in our recent actions.
Thank you.   2 Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir. I will begin the p ress conference by inviting S hri Jeevan Bha wasar from
Akashvani .
Jeevan Bha wasar, Akashvani :
Good afternoon, Sir . I would like to know  by when can we expect the public launch of
the CBDC and by when the common people would start using the CBDC?
Shaktikanta Das:
Deputy Governor  Rabi Sankar  may please answer this question.
T. Rabi Sankar :
Thank you Governor . We are not planning by keeping any specific date in our minds.
We have said earlier also that it will be gradual and calibrated because we would like
to assess the impact first and then we will go ahead with the policy of ‘ learn,  as we
go’. As of now , our plan is that there should be one million customers by the end- June
2023. Secondly, we are planning to have its interoperability with the UPI /QR code .
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir . Now I will move to  Piyush Shukla from the Financial Express .
Piyush Shukla, The Financial Express:
Good afternoon Governor . Just wanted your perspective on the SBI moving to the
Supreme Court, seeking clarification on fraud classification. The Supreme Court had
issued some notice regarding that  because some of the banks have stopped marking
accounts as fraud. They  are waiting for more clarity from the RBI. Is the RBI going to
issue a detailed report on fraud classification? Secondly, Sir, you had said that foreign
countries with excess Rupee balance can invest in G -sec and T- bills, so, actually what
is the amount that has been invested by foreign countries?
Shaktikanta Das:
The international settlement of  trade in R upee through the arrangement of R upee
VOSTRO accounts , the process has already started.  As regards investment in Indian
securities or bonds, etc .; being the first time , the central banks as well as  the banks
on the other side are seeking some further clarity  through bilateral discussions . It is
under discussion with them and we expect the process to begin soon.  With regard to
fraud classification, I would request  Deputy Governor  Shri Jain to take that  question.
M. K. Jain:
As you are aware that the Supreme Court has given its judgment that natural justice
has to be provided to the borrower before declaring the fraud and subsequently , SBI
filed the review petition.  The Supreme Court has clarified that  there is no need for
giving a personal hearing while they are allow ed to file a review petition for the
remaining part of  the SBI . So, we are reviewing the entire guidelines on fraud and we
will come out with our guidelines very shortly  in consultation with various stakeholders .  3 Nevertheless, the Supreme Court judgement is applicable to all regulated entities,
irrespective of the RBI's guidelines.
Piyush Shukla, Financial Express:
By when can we expect this circ ular to come  out?
M. K. Ja in:
Very shortly.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sirs. I will move on to Ms. Latha Venkatesh from CNBC TV 18.
Latha Venkatesh, CNBC TV18 :
This is regarding the withdrawal of ₹2000 notes. How much has come back so far?
How much of it was exchanged and how much of it came as deposits ?
Shaktikanta Das:
As on March 31, 2023, there was a total of 3.62 lakh crore  of ₹2000 notes in circulation.
After the announcement of withdrawal , so far  about 1.8 lakh crore of ₹2000 notes have
come back , which is roughly about half of the ₹ 2000 notes in circulation as on March
31, 2023. Regarding how much of them through exchange and how much through
deposits  requires reconciliation because we find that there is some amount of overlap
in reporting and we want to avoid any possibility of  double counting. However,  broadly
on a provisional basis, I can say that about 85% of the ₹2000 notes have come back
as deposits into bank accounts. L et me also take this opportunity to say that more or
less this is in line with our expectations  and the good thing is that there has not been
any rush in any of the banks. Going forward, I would appeal through you to everyone
that not to rush or not to go to the bank in a panic, go whenever you are free, and take
your time . But at the same time,  I wou ld make one more request , generally, the habit
is we do things at the last moment, so please avoid last minute rush in the last 10- 15
days of September .
Further, f or wider dissemination,  I will like to request in Hindi; जैसा �क म�ने दो स�ाह पहले
कहा था , जब भी आपको समय हो आप आराम से ब�क जाकर अपने ₹2000 नोट को या तो बदल लीिजये या
अपने खाते म� जमा कर द�। कोई जल्दबाज़ी करने क� ज�रत नह� है ; हमारे स्टॉक म�  कर�सी नोट्स क� कोई
कमी नह� है । आप अपने सुिवधानुसार इसे बदल या जमा करा सकते ह� । साथ मे यह भी आ�ह करता �ँ �क
30 िसतंबर क े  आिखरी 10 -15 �दन क े  panic rush का इंतज़ार नह� करक े  बिल्क अपनी सुिवधानुसार ,
अभी पयार्� समय है , इसे या तो अपने खाते म� जमा करा द� या ब�क से  बदल ल�।
Thank you.
Latha Venkatesh, CNBC TV18 :
Sir, my next question is on liquidity. There seems to be a greater willingness to do V -
RRRs,  that is the removal of liquidity and a slight hesitation in doing R epo auctions  4 which is giving liquidity. So , should we understand that the RBI would be happier if the
weighted average call rate lay between 6.5 % to 6.7 5%. I mean, the comfort is more if
it is higher and not as much when it is lower. C onsidering that banks also have been
hesitant, as you say that they  are very cautious about giving you money in V -RRR , will
you look for more enduring ways like an OMO purchas es or something like that?
Shaktikanta Das:
The target of the Monetary Polic y is the Policy Repo Rat e, which is 6.5%. W hat we
would like to see is that the overnight call rates are also aligned to 6.5%. Beyond that,
it is a function of day -to-day fluctuation or week -to-week  fluctuation in the overall
liquidity situation. So , we expect and would like the overnight call rates to be aligned
with policy rate . Whether there is a preference for V -RR or V-RRR that depends on
the prevailing situation in the market . As we have done over the last four days , we will
remain nimble and remain flexible and act swiftly. I have also said in my statement and
also mentioned in my opening remarks that we will do two -sided operations as per
requirement.
Latha Venkatesh, CNBC TV18 :
Other than Repo,  it seems that the banks have been cautious , will you look for other
instruments?
Shaktikanta Das:
As and when we decide,  you will know.  But banks have been cautious and let me
make also one point. There is still some amount of liquidity sitting there. When we say
banks are cautious ; let us remember that about ₹1.5 lakh crore have been mopped up
through V-RRR operations.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir. I will move on to Mr. Govardhan Rangan from the Economic Times .
M. Govardhan Rangan, The Economic Times:
On the liquidity issue,  there is a feeling that the entire liquidity dynamics have  changed
in the last few months because of the 24x7 p ayments. The 1% of ND TL that used to
be a case that it may have to be relooked at and you also mentioned in your speech
that banks are cautious . How do you address  this, is there a need for a policy over haul
or a need to relook at that?
Shaktikanta Das:
I would request Deputy Governor  Michael  Patra  to take that question.
Michael D. Patra:
It is true that there are payments transaction going through till the middle of the night.
But as banks get used to this, the liquidity is balancing out. We saw there was a lot of
tightness in the middle of May, but after that , there has been an easing of liquid ity. So ,
banks are slowly getting used to those transactions coming in late and in any case,   5 after 5:30 pm, we have standing windows open and a SISO  facility which will sweep
in and sweep out. So,  banks are not inconvenienced by it.
M. Govardhan Rangan, Economic Times:
Just on that because the banks are getting used to it, they are also feeling that neutral
liquidity itself will be a kind of surplus of ₹ 60-70,000 crore.  The depreciation of the
neutral itself is getting redefined.  Is that  the case?
Michael  D. Patra :
No, we abandon that quantitative ceiling.  Right now, we look at the call money rate
and look at it to get aligned with the Repo Rate. As soon as it gets aligned, we feel
liquidity is balanced out.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sirs. I will move on to Mr. Manojit Saha from Business Standard.
Manojit Saha, Business Standard:
The Reserve Bank released the list of online FOREX platforms last evening, which are
unauthori sed. Earlier also, there was a list, but those applications are still there in the
Google Play Store and all. Is there any further steps the RBI is contemplating to curb
those issues?
Shaktikanta Das:
Dr. Patra, you can take that question.
Michael D. Patra:
You are right that we issued a list yesterday. So,  there is a two -pronged approach to
this. One is to build up levels of awareness and for that purpose the RBI not only issues
those lists which say unauthori sed but we also give you a list of  authori sed platforms .
The other thing that we do is that we interact very closely with the enforcement
agencies and the Ministries like Information Technology and Finance,  and they are
taking action on an ongoing basis. We are already hearing of various platforms being
raided and assets seized. S o, action is taking place there. The third line of action
should be that the tech companies , which are uploading those mobile apps , should
apply caution and ensure that what they are uploading is by  the laws of the land.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sirs. I will move on to M s. Swati Khandelwal from Zee Business.
Swati Khandelwal , Zee Business:
The withdrawal of ₹2000 notes was a big move by the RBI since the last Monetary
Policy  announcement. E verybody was taken by surprise and of course,  you have
responded to that . This is on behalf of our consumers who watch us and ask us that
will the RBI issue a new ₹1000 note and whether ₹500 note will also see the same
fate as the ₹ 2000 notes.  What do you want to say to the people who have such
questions and what  is the RBI thinking on those lines ?   6 Shaktikanta Das:
You asked whether we are going to introduce ₹ 1000 notes or are we going to withdraw
the ₹500 note. I do not have any information on all these issues,  and we are not
thinking along those lines . Therefore, please do not do any sort of speculation in the
market . I would like to say to the general public through you not to speculate. As of
now, I have no information and we do not have any such idea.
Swati Khandelwal , Zee Business:
Thank you Sir. It was an i mportant clarification . Now, I have a question about  ECL.
The thought process regarding expected credit loss is that the banks are thinking it
would be implemented by June 30, 2023. I s it correct and what is the situation at this
moment ? If you can give an update on what is the Finance Ministry’s view on it ,
perhaps there is no consensus between the RBI and the Finance Ministry on that so
is that correct or not?
Shaktikanta Das:
What is going on between the RBI and Finance Ministr y even I am not aware, but I will
request Deputy Governor  Rajeshwar Rao to take that question.
M. Rajeshwar Rao:
We have received comments from all the concerned stakeholders . Those comments
are being evaluated. S ome more refinements and work are being done. At this p oint
in time, it  is not correct to infer that June 30th would be the date when it  is going to be
launched. That is an absolutely incorrect  assumption.  I will stop it with that.
Swati Khandelwal , Zee Business:
Can you give us a date?
Shaktikanta Das:
No, you look at our track record. What is our track record over the last few years? We
give the time for c ompliance. It is not that today we announce something and from
tomorrow introduce th ose regulatory guidelines. We will give sufficient time to the bank
to implement the ECL. I f you see over the last few years , whenever we issue any new
guideline , we give time to the banks to introduce from a particular date. I would like to
say that there  is no need to create any panic or anything about the ECL also . As the
Deputy Governor  has pointed out, comments have been received. They are under
examination,  and we will issue the circular, but we are mindful of the fact  that the banks
will need some time to implement it.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir. I will move on to Mr. An up Roy from Bloomberg.
Anup Roy , Bloomberg:
Thank you Sir. Sir, why not change the stance to neutral and have you pivoted?  Last
time, you stressed that this is a pause, not a pivot, but this time you did not mention
that so should we interpret it as a pivot?   7 Shaktikanta Das:
I would mention only if there were  a change. So,  it is a pause in this meeting of the
MPC and I have not said anything about the pivot, so whatever I said in the last
meeting that it  is not a pivot, I reiterate that.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you. We will move to Mr. Ankur Mishra from  ET Now.
Ankur Mishra, ET Now :
Good afternoon Governor . I want to ask regarding the stance,  you have said in your
speech that often it is said that  in the end,  it becomes a little difficult and then hence
you have mentioned that future actions will be based on evolving situation s. But as
per your assessment, only you have said that the situation has improved from the last
time, be it integrators or other things.  So again, how should we infer that not
mentioning of exact word of the pivot , it is not what you have mentioned but you believe
that it is we are much closer to the change in stance than  we were last time.
Shaktikanta Das:
I have said in my statement and that is the MPC's view  also that our target is 4% . So,
our effort will also  be to align all our actions  to move towards that target and reach the
target. It will,  therefore,  depend on the evolving situation. G iven the kind of
uncertainties , which still persist and I have listed them out in my statement , to say
anything other than what I have said – our endeavo ur is to align the inflation target to
4%, we will move towards 4%  and we will be very watchful of the evolving situation
and modulate our action suitably  – is not  desirable. About a year ago also, we have
said that given the high uncertainty,  which is prevailing all over not just in India,
particularly in the external sector and especially when we are in a tightening cycle, it
is not desirable to give any forward guidance because that may create expectations
which may not be aligned with our thinking or our action.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir. I will move on to Ms. Swati Bhat Shety e from Reuters.
Swati Bhat Shety e, Reuters:
I have a two -part question, first is apart from a slowdown in growth, what would be the
other factors that would prompt the MPC to start cutting rates ? Is there a level of real
rate, which will make it restrictive for the economy to keep growing? Secondly, there
are expectations that the US Fed could continue to keep hiking rates  so is the RBI
comfortable with a rising interest rate differential with the Fed?
Shaktikanta Das:
I will ask Deputy Governor  Dr. Patra to reply to this question, but one point I would like
to mention that our monetary policy actions, as I have been saying time and again,  are
determined primarily by domestic conditions . We do not look at the action of other
central banks to determine our actions. But yes, we do watch what other central banks  8 are doing, because that will have an impact on the  financial sector situation,  on
currency markets and other aspects, but our  actions are determined  primarily by our
domestic factors .
Michael D. Patra:
We have described to you what exactly our comfort zone is and that is  when inflation
aligns  with a target and growth returns to potential after the shock , it received from the
pandemic. Both are work s in progress . There is little better progress on the growth
front, inflation is also progressing towards our goal, but not as fast as growth is
normali sing. So, we look at both to take the next step.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir s. I will move on to Mr. Mayur Shetty from The Times of India.
Mayur  Shetty , The Times of India:
Governor  Sir, recently the Kanungo Committee had submitted a  recommendation on
customer service standards . So, I wanted to know how would these standards be
enforced,  and in that context , there were two incidences that videos which were
circulating on social media;  one was of a bank manager pushing the staff to sell
insurance policies instead of the need- based selling that the RBI requires and the
other is of regulated entity saying that i f people who do not want to be disturbed and if
they want to opt out of our calls then they should not come back for loans in future.
So, whether such issues would get addressed?
M. K. Jain:
Let me respond about the Kanungo Committee report , we have put out on our website
for public comments. By and large,  this Committee has focused on the adequacy of a
regulatory and institutional framework, the customer experience,  the efficacy of
grievance redressal, extent of customer education and awareness. These ar e the five
areas , where they have focused. W e will wait for public comments and thereafter we
will decide what can be implemented, and what cannot be implemented. On the calls
basically , as far as recovery agents are concerned,  we have already issued our
guidelines and we have put out our code that what they have to follow for the recovery
agents. For the marketing calls,  this is the decision of the individual banks , and the
TRAI  has to look into if there is a ‘ Do not Registry ’ done by any customers .
Nevertheless , this issue , which you have brought it out , will be examined  separately.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir. I will move to Ms. Gopika Gopakumar from the Mint.
Gopika Gopakumar , Mint:
Sir, at the time of demoneti sation,  the RBI had introduced an incremental CRR, do you
think that is required at this point in time,  and secondly do you think after SEBI , will the
RBI also be coming out with regulations or financial influencers?   9 Shaktikanta Das:
So far as financial influencers are c oncerned,  we have no such thinking. SEBI is
already dealing with it. We have no such thinking in the RBI to get into that territory .
With regard to the incremental CRR, that will depend on the situation.  I do not want to
speculate what action we will take, but just keep in mind that we have mopped up ₹ 1.5
lakh crore through our V -RRR auctions and that process is already . We will see going
forward.
Yogesh Dayal :
Sir, I will now invite Mr. Pankaj Aher from  Informist Media to ask his question.
Pankaj Aher , Informist Media:
Thank you Sir. There is a big difference between the earlier policy statement s and this
one in the fact that the earlier policy statement spoke predominantly about the flexibility
of the inflation target. Today you have been very clear that 4% is the target . It has
been a while since we heard that . I would like to know a bit more about that . Does the
market now take it that rate cut potentially or a stance change is on the table only when
inflation reaches  is 4%?
Shaktikanta Das:
What I have said is that our target and our endeavo ur will be to see that the inflation
aligns with the target on a durable basis . Let me clarify. Our effort is to ensure that the
actual CPI headline inflation alliance with the targets on a durable basis not a one-off
basis at any point of time. With regard to the band and specific target , the specific and
primary target of monetary policy is 4%. During the stressful times of COVID and
thereafter when the Ukraine War broke out and the fallout of the Ukraine War, we
operated within the band.  We use the flexibility,  which is available to the Monetary
Policy Committee . We operated within t hat band. W e were tolerant of inflation above
4% and our effort and focus  was to remain within the target band. N ow the situation
has changed. There is now great er certainly and I have mentioned it in my opening
lines also . The overall path is much clearer  than it was earlier. So, we are now targeting
4%, which is our primary target.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir , I will now invite Mr. Vishwanath Nair from BQ Prime.
Vishwanath Nair, BQ Prime :
Governor , I am coming back to the liquidity question because that is an important issue
at this point of time . You are talking about ₹ 1.5 lakh crore mop up from the system
through V-RRR.  Your auction w as like ₹4.5 lakh crore if we put all the auctions
together . I am  just trying to understand what is the reason for this caution among
banks . Secondly , if you look at the way the interest rates, lending rates and deposit
rates , are panning out in the system . The RBI data suggest that in April fresh loan and
fresh deposit  rates have fallen by 20 basis points which  is a marginal fall . But still,  at  10 a time when you are talking about status quo, rates falling may not go well for
transmission?
Michael  D. Patra :
The reason for caution among banks is that there is an eminent advance tax outflow
which is always sizable that will happen in the next week. So, they are holding back
money for that purpose. B ut as you saw we were persevering in our efforts and the
fact that we repeated our auctions indicated our purpose,  which is wh at we wanted to
convey. It was important therefore to withdraw that excess liquidity so that the deposit
rate and lending rate s huffling that was happening was more aligned with what the
interest rate cycle is and that is why we have withdrawn ₹ 1.5 lakh cr ore so far. As
Governor  pointed out that is exactly why we withdrew liquidity.
Shaktikanta Das:
It is necessary that any segment of the market does not prematurely assume certain things and then start cutting rates . Whether it is a lending rate or deposit rate. It is a
commercial decision as you know that both deposit rates  and lending rates are all
deregulated, banks are free to do it . But, if they are doing it on the assumption of a
certain action which is  likely to be taken by the  RBI that would be wrong and as Deputy
Governor  clarified our liquidity action also should be seen in the context that our
Monetary Policy stance and our policy rate are well -aligned with the interest rates
which are prevailing in the market including bank s.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sirs. I will request Anshika  Kayastha from The Hindu Business Line to go
ahead.
Anshika Kayastha, The Hindu Business Line:
Sir, has the framework  for settlement and write- off been triggered by the huge amount
of write -offs that we saw post -COVID and is the RBI concerned because the recoveries
from written -off account s have  been underwhelming so far ? Secondly, the RBI is
looking to issue FLDG guidelines but to understand what were the points  of contention
till now and what is direction the RBI is looking in now .
Shaktikanta Das:
On FLDG guidelines , you will have to wait for the circular , it will come out very shortly
and on the other component about compliance, etc., I would request Deputy Governor
Rajeshwar Rao to take that question.
M. Rajeshwar Rao:
It is not correct to infer that the write -offs have triggered the issue of a compromise
settlement. Essentially , what we have done is rationali se the existing framework for
compromise settlements. These instructions were issued across several circulars at
different points in time and they have now been brought in one place and enabled. What is more significant is  this has been extended to the urban cooperative banks also  11 which was not t here,  hitherto. This is the basic change and that is what has been done
nothing more than that.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir. Now I will invite Anurag Shah from ET Now Swadesh.
Anurag Shah, ET Now Swadesh:
The insurance sector is growing very fast, and the Government also wanted to
increase the penetration of insurance. The insurance industry has been demanding a
separate regulation on  insurance premium financing as it is there on home loans and
auto loans. I s the RBI thinking about this as  this will be a new avenue for financial
institution s and the way there has been changes in the technology it can be
implemented very well?
M. Rajeshwar Rao:
Credit decisions are decided by the banks based on board- approved policy. There is
no specific guideline of the RBI and insurance premium financing is one of the financial
product s and bank has to take a decision based on potential , and there is no guideline
of the RBI.
Anurag Shah , ET Now Swadesh:
Sir, many people have complained  that those who have no credit footprint do not get
an easy loan.  For example,  in a couple, the husband uses a credit card,  so he is getting
a loan offered and the rates are also less, but the wife has maintained financial
discipline and never taken any credit so she is not getting any loan and if she is getting
that too at very expensive rate. How do we cope- up with that in that continuation
somebody is maintaining a good credit score f or the last 20- 25 years, but because of
a mistake of a financial institution and because of miss -selling it is getting defaulted
and in return,  his score get s impacted, so in this what is the view of the RBI?
M. Rajeshwar  Rao:
I have said earlier also that the credit decision is based on the bank's  internal board
approved policy. Regarding the issues of credit history, the RBI has issued guidelines
in 2014 which says that credit history should not be the only factor while taking a credit
decision for first -time borrowers a nd first time borrowers should not be denied access
to credit just because they have no credit history. It is one of the best practices recommended by the RBI way back in 2014. Regarding the second question on the
wrong credit history, I would like to tell you that the credit information companies have
been brought under RBI  Ombudsman Scheme in August last year. Further, w e have
issued a guideline to CIC in October that an internal Ombudsman should also be appointed. We have a guideline that CICs and banks should correct the errors in credit
history  within 30 days  and if they do not rectify then one can complain to the internal
Ombudsman of CIC or the RBI Ombudsman regarding the same.
12 Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir. Now I invite Hitesh Vyas from The India Express to ask his question.
Hitesh Vyas, The Indian Express:
Sir, what will be the impact of the MSP hike on inflation and whether it has been
factored into your revised  projection currently .
Michael  D. Patra :
We got the MSP data yesterday and we find that the average increase across all crops
is about 7.5% to 8%. So, over and above our projections this will have impact to the
extent of 10 to 12 basis points.
Shaktikanta Das:
Part of the hike  is already built i nto our projections going by the past years . So, it will
be another 10 or 12 basis point s that is the quick calculations we have done overnight .
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir s. Now I invite Mr. Sachin Kumar from T he New Indian Express.
Sachin Kumar , The New Indian Express:
Sir, you mentioned that your target is to bring inflation to 4%. Given this , is it safe to
assume that now there will be no rate cut in the current fiscal ; and secondly , it is
regarding ₹2000 notes . There are many NRI s, who are outside,  and they may not be
able to come back by  that deadline. So, do you have some thinking to extend  that date
so that their problem can be addressed?
Shaktikanta Das:
I replied to this specific point on May 22, 2023 in a media interaction. I had specifically
said that we are aware that at an individual level or at a group level there could be
problems. There are Indians who are travelling abroad, and many of them stay with
their children for very long periods . There are Indians,  who are H1B Visa holders and
live abroad . They may have left behind a certain ₹ 2000 notes. We are sensitive to all
those representations which we keep getting. We will examine them and do whatever
is required, but our endeavou r will be to see that nobody is put into any inconvenience.
We want to see that the whole process goes  very smoothly and so far, you have seen
it is going very smoothly. With regard to inflation,  I thought I have replied to that.
Deputy Governor  Michael Patra can add anything in his language.
Michael D. Patra :
Governor  was very categorical about  what will the future look like. One thing he has
kept on stressing is that we were looking at inflation aligning with the target , not with
the inflation at target.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir s. I will move on to Mr. B enn Jose from PTI .
13 Benn Jose , PTI:
In Kerala,  there were reports not in the mainstream, but in online media and some TV
channels  that hundreds of customers of Federal Banks  were facing problem s wherein
after UPI payment , may be a small amount even a chai amount paying for a tea,  their
account gets completely blocked and when they walk into the bank , the bank refuses
and the answer they get is that the police from Bihar or Chhattisgarh or Haryana have
asked the banker to block their account . They freeze their account,  and they cannot
do any transactions.  There are some middlemen engaging and it is phishing,  and
police ask for lakhs of rupees to reopen their account.
Shaktikanta Das:
Deputy Governor  Rabi Sankar  can respond.
T. Rabi Sankar :
Offhand, there is no reason I can think of why an account should be blocked after the
transaction. If it is happening,  it is happening because of like you are saying police is
getting involved for law enforcement reasons then we will have to look into that  and
we will have to find out . If it is happening because of some problem at the bank end
then if these issues come to our notice we will look into  that as well.
Shaktikanta Das:
This problem  so far , which you are referring to,  has not come to our notice. As and
when it comes to our notice,  we will find out through our sources if there is any such
problem,  and we will examine it and we will deal with it.
Yogesh Dayal :
Thank you Sir s. I will take the last question from Manish Suvarna from Moneycontrol.
Manish Suvarna, Moneycontrol :
Sir, do you think the repo rate at 6.5% is appropriate to sustain growth in the long run,
second,  what is the status of that the RBI centralised portal for unclaimed deposit s?
Shaktikanta Das:
So, the first part of the question Deputy Governor Dr . Patra can take,  and the portal
Deputy Governor  Rajeshwar Rao can reply .
Michael D. Patra :
The rate of 6.5% is adjudged to be appropriate at this point of time and as  and when
we have new information or a new outlook on the growth,  we will take a new view on
the rate.
M. Rajeshwar  Rao:
The work on the portal and software development, etc ., is going on and as soon as it
is ready,  we will launch it.
Latha Venkatesh, CNBC TV18:
I have one question,  the market wanted to know after all the last two numbers came
down because of a fall in core inflation,  you do not see that momentum in the second  14 half because the reduction in the forecast was a little less than what others
arithmetically arrive d that. So , if you are not confident that the way core fell in the
second half , you could expect a lower inflation.
Shaktikanta Das:
There is a momentum, but we would like to see sustained momentum , not one- off.
There are still uncertainties . How the distribution and the timing of the monsoon,  the
spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon as I mentioned there is also a forecast of
a EL Nino . With so many uncertainties , our assessment ga ve these numbers. W e
would like to see a sustained momentum towards the alignment of inflation with the
headline targets.
Manojit Saha, Business Standard:
Will the RBI recommend to the government to withdraw the legal status of ₹ 2000 note
after September 30?
Shaktikanta Das:
To my knowledge, there is no such idea.
Yogesh Dayal :
