yesterday’s responses markets overall commentary move came surprise many people expecting hike weight expectation basis points think bears explanation chose take aggressive stance thi nk go back may policy place decision co ntext look back inflation trajectory last year bit going ba ck perhaps first quarter two distinct phases fact analysis well documented macro money developments looked changing drivers inflation fact three phases describe terms two end headline rate certainly problem around measure core non food manufacturing component started stabilise second half around came little bit month otherwise around went november december context approach validated calibration approach dealing clearly visible inflationary pressures point ry strong ones reserve bank india july page period starting march done roughly basi points reinforced shift call rate bottom corridor top around basis points end october early november new factor entered equation saw veryvery sharp increase commodity prices translated different significantly higher trajectory inflation starting early took stock number factor taken consideration whether going persistent budget position would fiscal position would post budget taken account looked inflation traject ory early part going ahead felt new situation combination commodity prices persistently buoyant domestic demand resulti ng much higher rate inflation case previous year really motivation may action moved basis points hike previous cycle may statement indicated trajectory inflation basically said would remain close current level around fo r period time start moderate towards second half year result among things cumulative actions monetary policy commodity pr ices seen risk terms also prospect rising clearly inflation risk factored calculations may policy statement three months later somewhat different situation co mmodity prices course whole series global developments get lack time commodity prices specifically pattern ha changed somewhat still high much expectation continue harden sense gives us relief looking ahead th e pressure exert domestic inflation remain likely become worse second factor taken consideration state domestic demands clearly interest rate hike basis points must start cutting demand certainly seeing signs discussions prior policy point repeatedly made banks difficulty passing credit particularly new capital investment consumer durables real estate pointed difficulty interest ratesensitive sectors suggested rates reached point beginning impact demand whether enough transition quickly bring inflation rates demand side judgment make look carefully corp orate numbers full set results q whatever early results could get time policy q yes clear signs moderation margins wi th projects pricing power coming dramatic shift keeping current rate inflation mind keeping fact trajectory likely remain level plus period reserve bank india july page time felt best course action course conti nue may stance continue basis point hike look ahead see play ing clearly expect growth slow somewhat demand compre sses last year’s growth estimated today indications might revised upwards already started see discussion public discourse partly new industrial production series suggest industrial growth somewhat higher course year previously thought actually moving plus around us reflects fairly significant deceleration moderation gr owth fact start impact inflation inflation numbe r said start come around novemberdecember cumulative impact rate actions demand help commodity prices may reinforce start soften period said really ha control point would prudent assume remain somewhat hostile range going forward perhaps getting worse result see inflation starting starts trend move march end people ndicated might somewh higher think important much number march end us projection rather beginning part downw ard trajectory inflation course extended following year continue take number broad scenario entering decide time right review stance change stance esse ntially driven said guidance two factors ha ppening commodity prices happening domestic demand show signs allowing inflation start trend clearly would right time review stance think process high inflation trajectory co ntinue next months watch clearly stance remains point antiinflationary believe also clear set indicators look review let stop brief opening rema rks open qa joined course deputy governors dr chakrabarty mr sinha mr khan executive directors – deepak mohanty mr gan dhi mr mahapatra head monetary policy division dr janakraj alpana killawala yes melissa go questions moderator thank ladies gentle men begin question answer session anyone wishes ask question may press touchtone telephone wish remove question queu e

question priority sector guidelines banks may credit policy mention revamp ex isting guidelines expect clarification dr kc chakrabarty see said committee constituted pending existing guidelines continue committee appointed appointed week’s time report expected four months’ time mahrukh adajania okay won’t change till committee appointed dr k c chakrabarty absolutely dr subir gokarn going end committee’s appointment going end recommendations accepted mahrukh adajania okay thank moderator thank next question th e line kaushik das deutsche bank mumbai please go ahead kaushik das dr gokarn mentioned end march flation projection gave guidance rather end target important trajectory inflation come prob ably decide let decide change monetary policy stance regardi ng wondering possible rbi give average wpi inflation financial year rather giving end march target also given fact look nonf ood manufactured goods inflation closely proxy core inflation least possible give end march target core inflation well dr subir gokarn actually first question actually policy statement given explicitly give n monthly number fan chart actually compute stop us giving consider second yes think work progress obvi ously forecast internally careful subject significant errors case guidance becomes little misleading implicit headline number traditionally giving projections also core consistent trajectory publish clearly part internal analysis kaushik das one question industrial production index talked earlier governor also talked kind gives faulty indications reserve bank india july page times important industrial production growth number far policy decision concerned today dr subir gokarn one input several said occasi ons perhaps audience sets inputs decision data models forecasts come series surveys including surveys companies industrial outlook su rvey referred mmd macro monetary developments doc ument well capacity utilisation survey order book inventory capacity utilisation cr edit conditions survey survey bank officials consu ltations whole range stakeholders try triangulate inputs try arrive picture consistent inference consistent largest number indicators get information iip important one recognise ar e limitations reject entirely see context hearing seeing indicators well kaushik das thank moderator thank next question line shubhada rao yes bank mumbai please go ahead shubhada rao thank good afternoon everyone act ually two questions th e first question regarding core inflation trend recent months think volatile times incremental data assumed larger significance seen clear trend q fy q either month month deseas onalised adjusted seen sharp drop one point average q fy monthovermonth trend core index even look seasonally adjusted come sharply lower reading much trend see comment latest core inflation monthovermonth sequential pa tterns reserve bank india statement would like hear thoughts one second academic question perhaps looking incipient signs moderation quantum hikes seen last months bps carry potential risk seeing growth going well comfort levels essentially quantum rate hike store large dose hike amidst oderating cycle one see risks growth spiralling lower fa ster anticipated two questions panel thank deepak mohanty shubhada think difficult really derive substantive conclusion looking happened q know th one month final data two months provisional data past ha seen substantial revision provisional data happening ca n see april nonfood manufacturing final data provision al gone really one compares reserve bank india july page q gives impression nonfood manufacturing really picked end march add together extent obviously show pattern clear deceleration one sure taken caution kind time series exercise end point data also creates problem give kind false number see momentum come see pr ovisional final year april uptrend let us hope moderates assumption moderation take place extent moderation need ascertain dr subir gokarn second question important indicated opening remarks fact signs moderation much evidence discussions stakeholders lead dilemma whether go stronger hike versus lower one think really worked favour stronger hike essentially robustness several components demand fact low interestsensitivity example consumption indications quite buoyant course ar e components interestsensitive seem showing signs moderation otherwise great signs secondly even ongoing fiscal consolidation process still significant contribution dema nd coming public expenditure know result crisis response substantially higher today crisis seen steady improvement fisc al situation hose two components essentially quite robust fiscal situation adjusting still quite strong given felt downside risk growth interest rate hikes would fairly bounded whereas upside risks inflation pa rticularly perception number action seen adequa te course people l expected mean everybody thought right thing predicting action making judgment opt imal thought stronger action essentially consistent new stance signalled may course downside risk growth pointed document indicated range think grow th may go end day also think strong lower bound risk whereas inflation risk unfortunately upward bound unbounded many ways may play balance risks favour going little aggressively inflation shubhada rao thank moderator thank next question lin e srinivas varadarajan credit suisse singapore please go ahead srinivas varadarajan would like thank panel taking questions two que stions first one goes follows one looks inflation expectations survey publish every quarter numbers th e average oneyear forward inflation reserve bank india july page expectations since september close around since october actually shifted policy shifte policy emphasises cycle average oneyear forward expectation close last published number period jan march oneyear forward ex pectation point try make seems alluded fiscal offsets monetary policy action fiscal impulse large advance tax refunds nrega indexation msp one course taking account anticipated food security act point policies welcome welfare perspective side effect terms keeping structural inflation inflation expectations high one reasons actually keep gr owth forecast upping yearend inflation forecast despite monetary po licy action basis points cycle also seems expectations real ly sensitive policy actions taken far kind point towa rds basically wage price spiral significant risk first question th e second question real rate india one takes sbi base rate quarter oneyear forward inflation expectations real rate still negative basis points would respond dr subir gokarn think first question put lo weight fact survey odd respondents inflation expectat ions surveyed cut across range socio economic categories relativel high weight high proportion people food largest single item household expenditure far true daily waged labourers selfemployed people formal sector kind relatively small proportion people whitecollar professionals could say recent experience food impact inflation expectations think playing significant role expectations moving certainly pay lot attention terms directionality wh ich point mentioned movement something important suggests people starting see inflation rising much terms actual number really weighted outcome sample composition think put caveats broader point expectations possibility translating wage demand think relevant read mmd towards end document introduced discussion wage dynamics significant obviously significant bargaining power many labour market segments translating heard anecdotally showing aggregate data well large wage increases ability index even implicit contracts informal market transactions quite high high expectations rising expectations certainly enhance risk spiral emerging recall one statements made macro money developments document need focus dealing wage price dynamics important issue dealing expectations even translate dire ctly household let us keep mind wage twosided contract whether worker asking wage employer reserve bank india july page willing give one similar expectations terms inflation able agree mutually acceptable inflation premium employers feeling pinch talking po ssibility moderation premium may forthcoming counterva iling force side even monetary policy showing indivi dual household expectations clearly impact potential employer wil ling pay given assessment business prospects transmission terms second question think fer back issue response previous question see much directly explicitly said clearly still significant role fiscal public spending playing demand terribly interestsensitive long continues adjustment ongoing ministry finan ce clearly laid year timeframe fiscal consolidation even ongoing still pl aying large role demand keeps pressure demand regardless monetary policy actions taken along consideratio ns feel demand quite robust good reasons example priv ate consumption spending also part reason decided stay take factors also taken consideration may policy di feel adequate ground sharply bring growth forecast emphasise we’ve given range mid point range deepak would like add deepak mohanty supplement terms inflation expectations survey dg clarified household survey much cannot read time horizon increases one year line mostly happens adaptive expectations expectations formed learning unless people see ground level prices coming change expectat ion much going think useful thing see current inflation three months line accurate terms validation subsequent kind data see inflation comes oneyear inflation expectation also coming think best way read inflation expectations main anchored quite relevant srinivas varadarajan question real rate take sbi base rate quarter oneyear forward inflation expectation may month forward closer dr subir gokarn think make distinction effective rate inflation person borrowing base rate relevant rate inflation business person wpi whole core component wpi cpi… think defining…real in… taking two numbers necessarily link think appropriate take wpi lending rates deposit rates also positive real point policy rate clearly lending deposit rates broadly reserve bank india july page srinivas varadarajan thank moderator thank next question line manvinder singh international institution studies please go ahead manvinder singh question panel rise policy rates created arbitrage opportunity interest rate di fferential bring foreign inflow country wanted know one thing rise inflows one hand lead appreciation exchange rate first question rbi allow appreciation exchange rate secondly allow incr ease foreign exchange reserves move rbi allows increased appreciation exchange rate rbi think lead lowering imported inflation dr sabir gokarn first question polic position intervene forex market objective determining setting exchange rate extent intervene done lot time essentially react sharp volatility rate determination mind exchange rate essentially market determined within broad contours capital controls debt flows inflow result interest rate arbitrage seeing point large inflow default response would let currency appreciate let market determine exchange rate would case significant accumulation reserves rupee appreciate yes obviously everything else remaining positive impact inflation extent imports become cheaper also contractionary sense exports become less competitive aggreg ate demand goes helps contain demand therefore bring inflation really matter magnitude happened last several months th rate fairly variable capital inflows much larger current account deficit much change exchange rate overall hypothetical situation yes would help deal appreciation reality even relatively open capital account point rupee moves tw directions moving distinctly one direction manvinder singh sir second question rbi says huge demand aggregate demand aggregate supply huge liquidity present economy think instead moving basis points rise repo reverse repo rate would good something would done crr front repo reverse repo would raised basis points dr subir gokarn yeah interesting point think distinguish notion liquidity referring broa der sense sort large buoyant demand economy talk liquidity talking reserve bank india july page resources available financial system basis expand credit typically banks would need liquidity support crr cash reserve ratio context liquidity actually deficit consistently since end may given see significant benefit using crr certainly tighten situation could also disrupt normal business activity banks availability cost liquidity become unpredictable since deficit already transmission policy rates actual lending rates quite strong saw yesterday soon polic many banks announced least thought two three banks announced ba se rate hike also roughly basis points transmi ssion quite strong impact seek achieve manvinder singh thank moderator thank next question lin e devika mendirat ta credit suisse singapore please go ahead devika mendiratta hi good afternoon thank much taking question question relates charts real interest rates quarterly macro publication released day totally take point let us look particular value real interest rates right flation rates use right like got chart showi ng banks lending rates real terms stated using wpi found interesting starting trend clearly downwards real rates actually fallen starting pretty much consecutively someone w ould look might say real rates seem low trend basis compared historical trend hence stimulative wondering thoughts please thank deepak mohanty yeah various calculations given absolutely right terms trend one looks secular decline real interest rate one really looks suppose take high growth phase calculations real interest rate could range around obviously quite lower stage course one factor one would take decade inflation rate also remained high couple years dr subir gokarn think important devika look structural changes financial changes taken place period time sure trend indication whether policy stimulatory contractionary revealing think seen course cycle period time keep mind onwards sign ificant changes financial sector including think slr brought don’t remember moved reserve bank india july page change was… small savings rate brought substantial change series deregulations market also clearly impacted trend think looking longterm necessarily give indication state policy think appropriately se en cycle devika mendiratta right thanks moderator thank next question th e line peckwee yeo rbs singapore please go ahead peckwee yeo hi good afternoon one quick question rbi actually see estimate trend growth potential growth economy dr subir gokarn use word ‘trend’ ‘poten tial’ bit semantic confusion public debate ‘potential ’ seen aspirational number prefer use word ‘trend’ asse ssment communicated mmd macro monetary development docum ent may chance look around peckwee yeo right trend growth would fiscal year ending going beyond particular trend growth rbi looking see somewhat non inflationary dr subir gokarn saying business usual trend essentially non inflationary sustain period time year period time without inflatio nary pressures becoming acute course raise requires bunch vestments repeatedly referred supply response concerns food infras tructure seeing pressure wages human capital skill ssue number constraints need addressed take trend rate growth higher business usual scenario clearly recent experience would suggest grow th rate significantly higher period time start see inflationary pressures becoming quite significant sort broad perhaps reasonable benchmark work peckwee yeo thank moderator thank next question lin e shishir shindekar byk college commerce nasik pl ease go ahead shishir shindekar thank good afternoon sir thanks organising event regularly shishir shindekar nasik reserve bank india july page dr subir gokarn hi shishir shishir shindekar question kind correlation observed repo rate rate inflation wpi well real gdp last three years specifically much time normally require transmission mechanism change monetary variables su ch repo rate change real economy thank sir deepak mohanty would see transmission quite st rong money market soon rates change see money market rates adjusting pretty quickly little slower debt market goes credit market late seen transmission credit market al quite good base rate system coming place less corresponding increase es taking place lending rate research would suggest pol icy instrument impact ultimate variables growth inflation lag assessment would suggest something year months kind lags terms policy instruments know lags variable depends structure economy moves moderator thank next question line varda pande birla mutual fund mumbai please go ahead varda pande hi good afternoon question actually timing aggression clamp inflation three tr iggers actually pointed may policy fuel price hike expected msp hike expected persistence nonfood manufacturing inflation terms expe ctations three counts scored high even may th june may two look nonfood manufacturing inflation trajectory february may well one concern play ed fuel price hike expected midjune done little later th point three triggers actually came june midquarter really kind aggression shown yesterday could shown june policy may expectations could come wh guidance march ’ number inflation opt june policy dr subir gokarn keep mind six weekly cyclical much less intense process midquarter think five quarters started midquarter intensity process quarterly describe previous response draw data model forecast company numbers company results conversations su rveys come us six weekly frequency sixweek ly review essentially based data releases two data release come quarterly policy th iip numbers reserve bank india july page wpi numbers also usual financia l data credit deposits little difficult course new process getting entrenched take might sort risky action basis relatively limited inputs although result difficulty cha llenges communication think choice june say look may think momentum still stance continues let us move aggre ssively might basis comprehensive set inputs got th e usual quarterly process really question much new information mu ch analysis information therefore ability little confident appropriateness decision varda pande understand reaction let us say procedural quarterly data inflow instead incrementally see daily basis dr subir gokarn sure follow saying th sounds right based two new sets two months data coming midquarter trying see whether reinforces quarterly assessment challenge us somewhat varda pande right right thank much moderator thank next question line parul saini rbs securities singapore please go ahead parul saini good afternoon thanks taking questi two questions actually one regarding core manufacturi ng inflation realise mentioned earlier numbers may june provisional put much faith seasonally adjusted trend show significant deceleration versus trend earlier calendar year look going forward even seasonally adjusted trend within rbi’s comfort zone yearoveryear core manufacturing inflation number would stay pretty high even december around given said tightening stance comes core manufacturing inflation goes significantly might helpful fo r us know matrix would looking closely would year overyear number impacted base affect could stay high even seasonally adjusted number coming also talked corporate pricing power regarding core manufacturing inflation expectations earlier results suggest lot margin compression coming thought ou think appropriate margin compression industrial companies seen significant margin compression two questions core manufacturing infl ation second question financial stability review points higher interest rates ar e significant risk asset quality even higher gdp slowdown given rate hikes reserve bank india july page come system think significantly threatening asset quality good get views thanks dr subir gokarn well first question although typi cally frame policy statements yearon year number process certainly review monthonmonth quarteron quarter adjusted numbers well ge sense momentum would discovered would go back months significant upward revision final numbers provisional actua lly resulted significant change picture one gets analysis one view degree rejected something place overall dash board one input clearly ther e evidence momentum dramatically changing well previous questioner raised issues momentum something keeping track put number think would difficult perhaps even appropriate think really question whether pattern consistent l ooking number going go mean going go pricing power gone going go overall demand gone see consistency corporate numbers production num bers price numbers see sort everything things pointing r oughly direction think gives us confidence trend underway base decision margin compression would say thin g made statement policy see significant certainly see compression significant suggest th early results odd companies friday policy analysed perhaps middle august full set analysis done review margin dynamics earnings dynamics input mid quarter going forward get early results q october statement ongoing process really ch ange break pattern keen see really necessarily numerical benchmar k keep mind established history relatively new recent inputs coming policy making process parul saini second question interest rate dr k c chakrabarty yeah see asset quality definite ly deteriorates rise interest rates financial stability report indicating interest rate brought asset quality otherwise deteriorate cautioning banks risk manageme nt monitoring system credit quality vigorous increase interest rate deterioration asset quality least partly risk mitigated quite sure enough gap risk manageme nt practices monitoring credit quality followup recovery efforts need accelerated cannot say reserve bank india july page increase interest rate asset quality deteriorates economy requires control inflation want increase interest rate done purpose different regarding financ ial stability warn system risk action taken parul saini sure clarify given expressedly said wait core manufacturing inflation come sustaina bly would numeric number mind looking septem ber october let us say monthonmonth manufacturing inflation come ye aroveryear numbers stay high see demand slowdown also margin compressed take reasons enough monetary policy stance change dr subir gokarn well september midquarter october quarterly clearly indicating give appropriate guidance statements parul saini thank moderator thank next question line pradeep mamak citibank mumbai please go ahead badri yeah name badri citibank c ouple specific questions specifically coming quarter policy fi rst question growth guidan ce sure percentage interest sensitive sector overall gdp services exports continue remain buoyant headline gdp within trend saying ignoring what’s happeni ng interest sensitive sectors continue antiinflationary stance second question inflation talked possible spike food fuel inflation coming months next policy stance precisely guided nonfood manufacturing inflation third question fiscal talk ed quite bit fiscal issues considered specific impact monetary actions nd sacrificing growth nearterm immediate fiscal situation revenue side dr subir gokarn well first question relation composition output think whatever scenario visualise growth emerges whatever composition sectoral activity drives significant decline broad category sectors one somewhere fairly quickly see profits earnings coming sector margins compressed also result lower pricing power pricing coming tracking components contribut ors inflation pick terms link real activity translating corporate numbers actual inflation numbers think looking numbers isolation looking terms eventually reflect terms reserve bank india july page trying bring inflation going drivers process second question respect spike quite get second question badri yeah talking food fuel price inflation could possibly go due msp reasons next policy guidance action going precisely based nfm food fuel etc dr subir gokarn clearly linkage first round sh ocks transmission larger inflation process going drive thinking sorry third one – badri fiscal dr subir gokarn oh yeah important point look tax buoyancy issue clearly base indirect taxes nominal gdp actual mix growth inflation important getting overa budget estimate don’t think would much shortfall indirect taxes direct ta xes may see compression earnings going may impact also ongoing process tax administrativ e improvements better monitoring better collections may actually offset think growth inflation numbers table although curre ntly slightly differ ent finance ministry direct bearing aspect may ot reasons fiscal slippage highlighted statements revenue accrual basis think much worry badri thanks moderator thank next question line soumyajit niyogi sbi please go ahead soumyajit niyogi yeah good afternoon soumyajit niy ogi sbi dfhi dr gokarn would like ask last policy seen growth reduced spite low money supply achieved deposit growth liquidity required antiinflationary stance would like continue low money supply deepak mohanty essentially antiinflationary stance would control liquidity alongside th would seen also credit projection also have… soumyajit niyogi second thing since yield curve ha flattened significantly sign longend curve hardened significantl say borrowing would mostly long end curve compared short end already reserve bank india july page government announced continue cash management bills obviously tbills continue dr subir gokarn mr khan address question mr khan cash management bills shortterm treasury bills basically meant shortterm capital mismatches meant fo r longterm requirements government far longterm requirement concerned fairly welldistributed allocation securities shortterm mediumterm nd longterm taking advantage flattening curve strategy compar atively increase size longterm strategy continues soumyajit niyogi okay thank alpana killawala take last two questions mellissa moderator sure next question lin e manish wadhawa n hsbc mumbai please go ahead manish wadhawan good afternoon would like seek vi ews trajectory monetary policy tightening basically whole idea since monetary policy tightening happened started nond irect approach slr hike seen basis points hi ke point time concern regarding kind slowdown talks moderation growth gone ahead basis points june basis points yesterday policy dr subir gokarn basis points may manish wadhawan may yeah basis pointsif could throw light factors existed talk wage pressures core inflation commodities firming could suggest gone dr subir gokarn think look three phase right listen introductory remark manish wadhwa yeah sure dr subir gokarn talking different trajectory th inflation important part explanation go back one step look exit prices also looking wh ere started particular cycle tightening remember st art normal situation started sort desperate situation driven crisis effective call rate reserve bank india july page started process two processes running parallel essentially correction process normalisation process also bit tightening reflecting inflationary forces seeing emerging economy year begin would refer discussion mmd first phase inflationary process driven food point obviously view food prices going amenable monetary policy need deal expectati issue justify tightening point normalisation tightening goi ng time started look phase two roughly july novemberdecember inflation actually started moderating headline came core contributing mainly nonfood primary products contributing one phase sort ended end early new shock commodity prices shock factor rising th ey significant today commodity prices even softening last weeks still higher year ago completely different inflation trajectory emerging early part responding aggressive actions think one see th logically continuous cycle two distinct breaks cycle one normalisation two recent shock terms global commodity price factor manish wadhawan appreciate thank much moderator thank last question line shubra mittal kotak mahindra mumbai please go ahead shubra mittal good afternoon question really talking right assumption normal monsoon wondering case monsoon fail would implications growth inflation upside risk inflation materialising downside risk growth also materialising simultaneously situation possibly could stance rbi dr subir gokarn moment since find analysis rainfall july really critical monsoon risk july fa r country production weighted index food production weighted ndex looking slightly normal ri sk significantly actually ab ated risk august july failure question would gained lot significance comfort fro july numbers august becomes inadequate yes crops affected obviously take consideration moment monsoon risk somewhat less significant would say significantly less significant went may cycle idea temporal distribution rainfall would july performance reassuring mo less nationwide food reserve bank india july page grain production weighted index see serious stresses emerging food structural issues talking impacting food prices added burden bad monsoon unl ikely part story shubra mittal thank dr subir gokarn going bring close th ank participating appreciate questions asked hope th people get chance ask questions benefitted listening questions responses next conference would post oc tober policy although diwali day immediately policy may tweak schedule little bit look forward touch point th format certainly ways another event thank mu ch listening best moderator thank ladies gentlemen behalf reserve bank india concludes conference call thank joining us may disconnect lines
