innovations banking emerging role technology ai remarks delivered virtually shri rajeshwar rao deputy governor reserve bank india – december th annual conference indian economic association delhi distinguished participants good morning outset let thank organisers inviting giving opportunity share thoughts pertinent theme finance banking technology address would largely focus rbi’s efforts foster innovation financial ecosystem emerging technologies artificial intelligence likely reshape financial landscape banks played extremely important role supporting growth story indian economy analyse evolution indian banking sector last decades classify evolution three distinct phases – post nationalisation liberalisation third current phase could term democratisation level financial intermediation time independence quite low india – ranging per cent gdp less case next two decades limited financialisation outreach banking services scope mobilise deposits facilitate credit flow support aspirations developing nation constrained trend changed nationalisation banks ensured wider banking reach led opening bank branches across country resulting greater mobilisation deposits growth credit primarily catering credit needs priority sectors inputs provided chandan kumar pradeep kumar saurabh pratap singh gratefully acknowledged figure historical overview indian banking second distinctive phase evolution banking sector observed postliberalisation phase till period financial intermediation fundamentally transformed globalisation integration opened various growth opportunities leading increase demand credit also tune spirit economic reforms private entities allowed enter banking sector supplemented collective endeavour banking industry support growth story economic growth aided institutional attendant reforms along greater technological adoption banking sector spurred robust growth deposit credit period first two events namely nationalisation liberalisation definitive nature ie attribute definite time stamps events third phase – democratization banking services currently experiencing continuing gradual transformative process pace accelerated last years democratisation phase coagulated late underpinned trinity financial inclusion increase financial literacy focus nationalisation liberalisation democratisation consumer protection phase also witnessed massive expansion banking outreach especially amongst hitherto “excluded” sections innovative delivery models use banking correspondents democratisation financial services got major push pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana direct benefit transfer dbt scheme along proliferation mobile telecom services would mark say phase perfect combination demand pull supply push models working tandem today witnessing unfolding true democratisation financial services customers greatly enabled make informed choices among suit available financial products offered banks financial service providers discussing role banks india’s economic journey let’s lose sight contribution increasing importance financial intermediaries although bank credit remains dominant mode meeting growing credit needs commercial household sectors share nonbank financial companies micro finance institutions late market instruments also increasing nonbanks innovative delivery appraisal methods expanded penetration credit across geographical length breadth country along banks contributed immensely journey democratisation financial services figure flows resources commercial sector ₹ lakh cr india made remarkable progress years become fifth largest economy today also poised become third largest economy next years aspiration becoming developed nation reserve bank played crucial role unfolding growth
