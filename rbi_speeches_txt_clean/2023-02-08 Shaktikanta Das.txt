first yes possible inputs liquidity management said morning variety instruments manage short term liquidity well longterm liquidity omos one far optimal l evel crr goes think strong reason right move away level also looking entire liquidity frame work next months review keep apprised developments jayesh ku mar kotak securities cpi forecast assumed crude oil remain current level convenience forecast dr raghuram g rajan michael would like take dr michael patra know every forecast set certain initial conditions assumption initial conditions takes account recent developments spot future market also consistent forecast made agencies like imf international energy agency promit sengupta aiwmi given lag wage transformation time latest norms disclosure stressed assets increased banks ’ cost since recent result two india’s big banks show sorry state affairs think going forward entire banking system absorb se systemic risk dr raghuram g rajan okay long question first think would mischa racterization say sorry state affairs yes stressed assets need get banks continue action taking put back track broadly speaking process well underway attempt make sure across board end process banks wit h relatively well understood transparent balance sheet adequately provisioned think getting think enough capital system various scenario suggest would enough variety eventualities capital absorb potential losses happen think system poised fund future growth end exercise think one alarmist process well hand clearly involves short term subtractions profit loss account banks provision said repeatedly assets come back track provisions come back profitability best take precautionary measures hopefully growth picks economy picks world economy stress ed sectors improve making sure dependent hope improvement fact positioned variety alternative firmly believe system postpone process line may get much bigger harder handle government rbi together moving along banks sanj ana dadawala ubs securities recently referred imf estimates india’s consolidated fiscal deficit figures central government room given oil etc states clearly would look pay commission implementation states leading effective cons olidated fiscal expansion india terms impact macro parameters dr raghuram g rajan let ask dr patel answer dr urjit r patel aware central government actually built provision th pay commission impact per medium term expenditure framework february additional expenditure due th pay commission projected crores states need emulate c enter build buffers prior implement ing th pay commission recommendations would good housekeeping amit agrawal societe generale think ecb loans hedging last data point given th august meeting talked ecb hedging q think foreign loan repayment problems manageable inr depreciating dr raghuram g rajan let ask mr khan address shri h r khan actually trying fine tune data collection system things stand nine months april december less figure around intention hedge trying prescribing hedge ratio corporates regulatory side trying sensitize risks involved unhedge exposure provisioning capital charge norms trying get capturing data one side side recent changes w e announced th november focus rupee denominated ecbs exchange risk lender example infrastructure dollar balance sheet moved rupee side help mitigate external loan related exposure third point ecb recent past robust compare last year year ecb lower may around million million think serious problem account prudential measure place trying move people rupee denominated dr raghuram g rajan also two reasons may understating ext ent hedges first include entities natural hedges essentially price dollars second ecb borrowing dollars course bulk remember rupee depreciating dollar actually strengthened currenc ies careful saying immediately exchange rate depreciation fact real effective terms really moved year manish banthia icici prudential amc though talk real gdp nominal gdp much lower trend take five year government bonds proxy riskfree rate nominal interest rates higher nominal growth income levels go interest cost affects debt payment capabilit ies rbi’s view dr urjit r patel well currently five year government bond yield ministry finance’s mid year review nominal gdp growth projected therefore nominal income growth higher tha n interest cost even example rajesh agr awal bank f america going back september policy first external developments august important factor rbi cutting reported bps similar risk development january second also highlighted expected one year bill would roughly higher one year expect ed inflation one year bill yield fall ha trading forecasted inflation end excluding pay commission impact two factors relevant today deciding rates dr raghuram g rajan always pick couple factors say policy driven look whole range factors policy determined agglomeration factors would fixate one two say driving policy else would replace us machine give rule said think point made today wai ting see whether projections inflation develop whether incoming information inflation remembe r last readings want see new readings pl ay sense come want get certainty also next month get lot events happening important budget well implementation pay commission recommendation allow us better sense path future inflation certainly wait watch mode badri nivas chakravarty citibank last para policy mentioned “ structural reforms budget create space monetary policy support growth” open possibility inter meeting cut would say emergency situation intermeeti ng dr raghuram g rajan think policy advertise deny inter meeting cuts necessary undertake think central bank ever binds hands said past w ill reiterate typically inter meeting cuts happen time great sense urgency sometimes signal broad change direction policy really employed last time nd think centre stage point see rationales strong want either say going deny possibility namrata mittal sbi mutual fund looking weighted average call money rate well anchored repo rate measures money market rate like c p cd rates moving high higher rates market instruments impede transmission indicative liquid ity shortage economy view dr ur jit r patel times easing cycle cp cd rates actually also moved central bank operational daily level look policy repo rate call weighted average call market rates moving together difference two actually come fiscal year cp cd rate movements could also reflecting things transmission repo rate call money rate conse quently beyond dr raghuram g rajan think engaged certainly trying look liquidity conditions liquidity framework factors looked general point sense rket certainly demand liquidity also supplying plenty demand proof pudding precisely weighted average call rate hugging policy rate vishal goel ubs securities question stressed loans scope asset quality review rbi rbi go weak corporates banks select corporates dr raghuram g rajan let ask mr mundra answer question shri ss mundra see scope sense conduct asset quality review banks every year difference process time come rather spacing year pooled within certain period otherwise followed process past year together given advantage accounts rather looking isolation could looked totality across banking system observations discussed banks shared banks encouraged proactively conservatively look accounts classify appropriately need prepare future possibility weakness arising way enhanced provisioning vishal goel basically assume rbi already highlighted like almost cases would thought stressed think like would list come rbi shri ss mundra think appreciate one thing portfolio static entity one give point time look portfolio always development either take account identified earlier positive movement happened looking economy around developments may inclusion say point time reasonable assurance larger part portfolios looked dr raghuram g rajan couple additions one course banks look entire portfolio time plus look entire portfolio perhaps degree scrutiny annual financial inspections think answer broadly yes mr mundra said bulk problem looked us detail also broadly looked us banks contin ue looking second even course process height ened awareness proactive behavior banks loans actually turned around loans put back track promoters selling ass ets brining money etc f course reverse also happen loans normal may go track something dynamic situation watch see broadly yes anurag mantr jefferies firstly assume asset classification accounts identified review uniform across banks end fy end two quarters shri ss mundra exactly mean uniform anur ag mantr sir example certain banks spoken second degree effects asset quality review terms may bank classifying n account npa another probably asking end accou nts identified potentially stressed asset classification across banks currently diverging shri ss mundra think explanation asked also contained previous reply let clarify asset classification continue governed rule based system vogue point time within quite possible account npa one bank may npa another bank viewed record recovery perspective essentially two outcome governor mentioned identification come bank per rule classified npa trigger two things one may corrective action part promoters well banks may need account slipping npa category banks existing bank also upgrade period time outcome could wh en account npa bank may gives indication banks become sensitive weakness account start preparing weakness manifest way provisioning whole e xercise moved direction going forward mentioned either account come back upgraded category f provisioning started prepares banks better deal account really falls npa category anurag mantr secondly could help us understand would typical haircut would assumed various stressed sectors like say iron steel metals infra etc various scenario would worked dr raghuram g rajan typically stress particular loan depends period deterioration taken place longer period deterioration bigger haircut sense don’t think uniform number give account toaccount basis broadly soon entity starts getting period say cash flow stress period onwards account ages extent provisioning required goes anurag mantr could give us take takeover discom bonds states extra bonds issued discoms would bagged states terms asset classification provisioning dr raghuram g rajan state replace bank’s loan bonds equal value state asset classification performing since states paying performing loan investment essentially anurag mantr even though bonds would issued discoms eventually bagged states issued states directly dr raghuram g rajan think still discussing plays bonds issued state banks lieu loans banks made discoms absolutely question asset quality dhaval gada motilal oswal securities firstly rbi asset quality review cover stressed exposures banks overseas operations well also exposures stressed group taken credit substitutes second question clarity balance sheet cleanup march mean going towards direction banks recognize potential stressed asset npa increase coverage exposures march could see increase provisioning even subsequent years dr raghuram g rajan second question intent broadly get problem aken care time shri mundra said continuing loans coming back standard classification loans going hope time bulk exercise finished positives match negatives sense balance sheet stabilized moreover balance sheet transparent know problems largely taken care shri ss mundra add considering first part question overseas exposure mentioned whole exercise intended overall review encourage banks proactively deal problem know large part overseas exposure banking community respect entity exposure sitting india n book kind review done banks take proactive measure think quite logical would looking – exposure sitting books india well exposure sitting overseas books dhaval gada sir would possible give broad sense would level provisioning quantum stress ed loan could materialize whole exercise dr raghuram g rajan moving target said mapped different scenarios think important banks basically follow process think good indicator probably results declaring clean don’t want pre judge process giving numbers done basically looked variety possible numbers various scenarios assured system enough capital absorb numbers well truly feasible possibility mahrukh adajani ya idfc question also pertains asset quality basically review asset quality review seen bank results seen similar size banks reporting divergent asset quality go data available whether mca data sector wise disclosures banks feel right divergence would review review dr raghuram g rajan know going actually constant communication banks prepare declare results certainly consult us intent essentially making sure level playing field disclosures see sense mr mundra said banks record recovery technical phrase implying history payments loan loan may performing one bank may nonperforming another bank simply borrower keeping one bank’s payments time asset classification differences tend equalize reason may certain bank classified particular loan classified elsewhere extent may variation broadly announcements banks reflect sense need see bank announcing relatively low provisioning time probably means need shri ss mundra would say similar size banks mean similar kinds portfolios banks may similar size portfolios may vastly different even accounts sitting portfolio banks quite possible loan size different think things would ultimately reflect level provisioning charge pl respective banks make hemendra bhatia vadilal forex look indian rupee last one month almost appreciated chinese yuan policy rbi actually allow rupee depreciate us dollar counter yuan depreciation dr raghuram g rajan repeat “ mantra ” actually follow intervene case excessive volatility try maintain level rate depreciation currencies done continue don’t look part icular currencies say moved lot intervene basis srinivas v deutsche bank given nominal growth challenge economy faces right given backdrop really imposition inflation targeting framework really necessary balance given nominal growth challenge case actually change functioning interest rate corridor current width basis points calibrate lower may basis points recalibration targeted liquidity deficit keeping sanctity inflation targeting framework dr raghuram g rajan missing link nominal g dp “difficulty ” corridor f irst would say seems cpi still services accounting value added assuming deflationary structure economy point perhaps little stretched denying fact overall gdp deflators depending calculate come hard see significant negative given size services economy well extent agriculture sector yes anufacturing experiencing period deflation largely result lower input cost much traditional reasons think nominal gdp problem extent perhaps overstated point let us see progresses fact actual problem see inflation coming substantially give monetary policy sufficient room act broader issue size corridor amongst issues explore take verall look framework srinivas v clarify link really meant clear really transmission perspective given shock degrees freedom provided changing width corridor dr raghuram g rajan biggest contribution transmission probably change marginal cost pricing april st would direct contribution credit course may mind transmission bond markets said take overall view see additional concerns broadly speaking point think reasonable job providing liquidity mangesh kulkarni almondz global securities wanted know progress gyan sangam meeting held last year next gyan sangam meeting expected shri ss mundra would appreciate gyan sangam exercise rbi’s presence observer get detailed elaborate answer question needs direct ed elsewhere second part question understand next gyan sangam proposed held first week march brinda jagirdar independent economist given books banks still concern government moved small saving rate bond market rates also softened conducive conditions transmission monetary policy rate dr raghuram g rajan good question guess tried answer different ways give phrase ‘small saving rates’ clearly looking government linking bond market rates allow flexible time give investors put money small saving instruments n adequate return ties market returns help transmission broader issue transmission shri khan said bond markets time think credit markets also clearly looking sense come april st change marginal cost pricing well time banks compete lend think see greater transmission take place optimistic matter time rather significant impediments process alpana killawala optimistic note shall close dr raghuram g rajan thank alpana killawala thank sir thank e veryone joining moderator thank much ladies gentlemen conclude conference call thank joining us may
